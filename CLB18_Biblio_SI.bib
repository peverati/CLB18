  abstract = {We present a quantum chemistry benchmark database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions (GMTKN24). It is an unprecedented compilation of 24 different, chemically relevant subsets that either are taken from already existing databases or are presented here for the first time. The complete set involves a total of 1.049 atomic and molecular single point calculations and comprises 731 data points (relative chemical energies) based on accurate theoretical or experimental reference values. The usefulness of the GMTKN24 database is shown by applying common density functionals on the (meta-)generalized gradient approximation (GGA), hybrid-GGA, and double-hybrid-GGA levels to it, including an empirical London dispersion correction. Furthermore, we refitted the functional parameters of four (meta-)GGA functionals based on a fit set containing 143 systems, comprising seven chemically different problems. Validation against the GMTKN24 and the molecular structure (bond lengths) databases shows that the reparameterization does not change bond lengths much, whereas the description of energetic properties is more prone to the parameters' values. The empirical dispersion correction also often improves for conventional thermodynamic problems and makes a functional's performance more uniform over the entire database. The refitted functionals typically have a lower mean absolute deviation for the majority of subsets in the proposed GMTKN24 set. This, however, is also often accompanied at the expense of poor performance, for a few other important subsets. Thus, creating a broadly applicable (and overall better) functional by just reparameterizing existing ones seems to be difficult. Nevertheless, this benchmark study reveals that a reoptimized (i.e., empirical) version of the TPSS-D functional (oTPSS-D) performs well for a variety of problems and may meet the standards of an improved functional. We propose validation against this new compilation of benchmark sets as a definitive way to evaluate a new quantum chemical method's true performance.},

  abstract = {For years, there has been ongoing interest in experimentally and theoretically understanding inversion and racemization processes. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no computational study that systematically investigated how well low-level quantum-chemical methods predict inversion barriers. Herein, we provide an answer to this question and we present the INV24 benchmark set of 24 high-level, ab initio inversion barriers. INV24 covers inversion in triatomics, in pyramidal molecules, in one cyclic system, and in various helical and bowl-shaped compounds. Our results indicate that previously applied DFT approximations combined with small basis sets are not reliable enough and that at least a triple-{$\zeta$} basis is needed for meaningful results. Moreover, we show that intramolecular London dispersion influences the barriers by 2 kcal/mol or more and that dispersion corrections should always be applied to DFT results. With our analysis of 34 DFT approximations, we can reproduce the well-known Jacob's Ladder scheme with (meta-)generalized-gradient-approximation methods underestimating barriers and global-hybrid DFT functionals performing better. Range-separated hybrids or Minnesota-type hybrids are not particularly superior to more conventional methods, such as B3LYP-D3. The by far best results are achieved with dispersion-corrected double hybrids, which give results below the chemical accuracy target of 1 kcal/mol. They also outperform wave-function second-order perturbation theory approaches and we recommend using them whenever possible. Given that our systematic study of INV24 is the first of its kind, our findings have the potential to change common practice in this field and they will guide future investigations of inversion processes.},

The valence functions for the smaller representation (3-21G) have been taken directly from the larger (6-21G), preventing their collapse inwards to make up for deficiencies in the inner-shell region. This is necessary to ensure a good description of bonding interactions which necessarily involve overlap of valence functions. Equilibrium geometries, vibrational frequencies, relative energies, and electric dipole moments calculated with the use of the 3-21G basis set for a number of molecules containing second-row atoms are nearly identical with those obtained from the larger 6-21G representation. Compared to experiment they are consistently superior to properties derived from the STO-3G minimal basis set, and of comparable quality to those obtained from the larger 4-31G split-valence representation. The 3-21G basis set comprises the same number of primitive Gaussian functions as STO-3G (although a significantly greater number of basis functions), and should be nearly as efficient computationally as that representation for applications which require evaluation of energy derivatives as well as the energy itself (e.g., determination of equilibrium geometry and calculation of vibrational frequencies). It is significantly less costly to apply than the 4-31G basis set, and would appear to be the method of choice for split-valence level Hartree-Fock calculations on moderately sized molecules.},

The method used is to integrate a modification of the equation outwards from initial conditions corresponding to a solution finite at               r               = 0, and inwards from initial conditions corresponding to a solution zero at               r               = {$\infty$}, with a trial value of the parameter (the energy) whose characteristic values are to be determined; the values of this parameter for which the two solutions fit at some convenient intermediate radius are the characteristic values required, and the solutions which so fit are the characteristic functions (\textsection\textsection{} 2, 10).                                         Modifications of the wave equation suitable for numerical work in different parts of the range of               r               are given (\textsection\textsection{} 2, 3, 5), also exact equations for the variation of a solution with a variation in the potential or of the trial value of the energy (\textsection{} 4); the use of these variation equations in preference to a complete new integration of the equation for every trial change of field or of the energy parameter avoids a great deal of numerical work.                                         For the range of               r               where the deviation from a Coulomb field is inappreciable, recurrence relations between different solutions of the wave equations which are zero at               r               = {$\infty$}, and correspond to terms with different values of the effective and subsidiary quantum numbers, are given and can be used to avoid carrying out the integration in each particular case (\textsection\textsection{} 6, 7).                          Formulae for the calculation of first order perturbations due to the relativity variation of mass and to the spinning electron are given (\textsection{} 8).             The method used for integrating the equations numerically is outlined (\textsection{} 9).},

  abstract = {The methods of solution of the wave equation for a central field given in the previous paper are applied to various atoms. For the core electrons, the details of the interaction of the electrons in a single                                n                 k                              group are neglected, but an approximate correction is made for the fact that the distributed charge of an electron does not contribute to the field acting on itself (\textsection 2).                          For a given atom the object of the work is to find a field such that the solutions of the wave equation for the core electrons in this field (corrected as just mentioned for each core electron) give a distribution of charge which reproduces the field. This is called the self-consistent field, and the process of finding it is one of successive approximation (\textsection{} 3).                            Approximations to the self-consistent field have been found for He (\textsection{} 4), Rb               +               (\textsection{} 5), Na               +               , Cl               -               (\textsection{} 9). For He the energy parameter for the solution of the wave equation for one electron in the self-consistent field of the nucleus and the other corresponds to an ionisation potential of 24{$\cdot$}85 volts (observed 24{$\cdot$}6 volts); this agreement suggests that for other atoms the values of the energy parameter in the self-consistent field (corrected for each core electron) will probably give good approximations to the X-ray terms (\textsection 4).                                         The most extensive work has been carried out for Rb               +               . The distribution of charge given by the wave functions in the self-consistent field is compared with the distribution calculated by other methods (\textsection{} 6). The values of X-ray and optical terms calculated from the self-consistent field show satisfactory agreement with those observed (\textsection{} 7).                          The wave mechanical analogue of the case in which on the orbital model an internal and an external orbit of the same energy are possible is discussed (\textsection{} 8).},

  abstract = {Accurate electronic barrier heights are obtained for a set of nine proton-transfer tautomerization reactions, which are either (i) uncatalyzed, (ii) catalyzed by one water molecule, or (iii) catalyzed by two water molecules. The barrier heights for reactions (i) and (ii) are obtained by means of the high-level ab initio W2.2 thermochemical protocol, while those for reaction (iii) are obtained using the W1 protocol. These three sets of benchmark barrier heights allow an assessment of the performance of more approximate theoretical procedures for the calculation of barrier heights of uncatalyzed and water-catalyzed reactions. We evaluate initially the performance of the composite G4 procedure and variants thereof (e.g., G4(MP2) and G4(MP2)-6X), as well as that of standard ab initio procedures (e.g., MP2, SCS-MP2, and MP4). We find that the performance of the G4(MP2)-type thermochemical procedures deteriorates with the number of water molecules involved in the catalysis. This behavior is linked to deficiencies in the MP2-based basis-set-correction term in the G4(MP2)-type procedures. This is remedied in the MP4-based G4 procedure, which shows good performance for both the uncatalyzed and the water-catalyzed reactions, with mean absolute deviations (MADs) from the benchmark values lying below the threshold of "chemical accuracy" (arbitrarily defined as 1 kcal mol(-1) {$\approx$} 4.2 kJ mol(-1)). We also examine the performance of a large number of density functional theory (DFT) and double-hybrid DFT (DHDFT) procedures. We find that, with few exceptions (most notably PW6-B95 and B97-2), the performance of the DFT procedures that give good results for the uncatalyzed reactions deteriorates with the number of water molecules involved in the catalysis. The DHDFT procedures, on the other hand, show excellent performance for both the uncatalyzed and catalyzed reactions. Specifically, almost all of them afford MADs below the "chemical accuracy" threshold, with ROB2-PLYP and B2K-PLYP showing the best overall performance.},

  abstract = {Relativistic compact effective potentials (RCEP), which replace the atomic core electrons in molecular calculations, have been derived from numerical Dirac\textendash Fock atomic wavefunctions using shape-consistent valence pseudo-orbitals and an optimizing procedure based on an energy-overlap functional. Potentials are presented for the third-, fourth-, and fifth-row atoms of the Periodic Table (excluding the lanthanide series). The efficiency of molecular calculations is enhanced by using compact Gaussian expansions (no more than three terms) to represent the radial components of the potentials, and energy-optimized, shared-exponent, contracted-Gaussian atomic orbital basis sets. Transferability of the potentials has been tested by comparing calculated atomic excitation energies and ionization potentials with values obtained from numerical relativistic Hartree\textendash Fock calculations. For the alkali and alkaline earth atoms, core polarization potentials (CPP) have been derived which may be added to the RCEP to make possible accurate molecular calculations without explicitly including core-valence correlating configurations in the wavefunction. Keywords: model potentials, effective core potentials, transition metals, relativistic calculations.},
