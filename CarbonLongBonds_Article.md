**Abstract:** In this Letter, we introduce a new database called carbon long bond 18 (CLB18), composed of 18 structures with one long C–C bond. We use this new database to evaluate the performance of several low-cost methods commonly used for geometry optimization of medium and large molecules. We found that the long bonds in CLB18 are electronically different from those found in barrier heights databases. We also report the unexpected correlation between the results of CLB18 and those of the energetics of spin states in transition-metal complexes. Given this unique property, CLB18 can be a useful tool for assessing existing electronic structure calculation methods and developing new ones.

## Introduction

Organic molecules with long covalent carbon–carbon bonds have been known for almost forty years. The crystal structure of 1,1,1,2,2,2-hexakis(3,5-di-*tert*-butylphenyl)ethane (CLB18_1 in **Table 1** below) was first reported in 1986,[@kahr1986] presenting a carbon–carbon bond length of 1.67 Å (as a comparison, the C–C bond in ethane is "only" 1.54 Å). Many other structures with unusually long C–C bonds have been successfully synthesized and characterized using X-ray diffraction since then.[@fokin2012;@li2019;@ishigaki2018;@kuroda2019] Such compounds exhibit a range of C–C bond lengths between 1.60 Å and 1.99 Å.[@li2019] These molecules have also attracted the attention of the computational community. For example, density functional theory (DFT) has been successfully applied to study the stability of 1,1,1,2,2,2-hexakis(3,5-di-*tert*-butylphenyl)ethane and the instability of the closely-related molecule hexaphenylethane.[@grimme2011a] Other studies demonstrated that DFT calculations with a hybrid exchange–correlation (xc) functional approximation successfully reproduce the experimental bond lengths of the C–C long bond for several of these compounds.[@li2019;@grynova2018;@fokin2012;@kuroda2019]

In this Letter, we introduce a new database called carbon long bond 18 (CLB18), composed of 18 structures with one long C–C bond. We use this new database to evaluate the performance of several low-cost methods commonly used for geometry optimization of medium and large molecules. In addition, we investigate whether there is a connection between the long bonds in CLB18 and the transient long bonds in the 34 transition states structures contained in the BH76 database of barrier heights.[@zhao2005;@zhao2005b;@zheng2009;@peverati2014a]

## The CLB18 database

The CLB18 database contains 18 minimum-energy structures with one reference bond distance for the long C–C bond in each molecule taken from the experimental crystal structure. Fifteen molecules are taken from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), while the remaining three are taken from ref. [@ishigaki2018]. The shortest C–C bond length is 1.627 Å (in CLB18_3), while the longest is 1.987 Å (in CLB18_18). The average C–C bond length is 1.766 Å. The experimental accuracy of the first three structures (CLB18_1, CLB18_2, CLB18_3) is $\sim 10^{-3} \text{Å}$, while for all others is $\sim 10^{-4} \text{Å}$. All the structures and the reference C–C bond lengths are reported in **Table 1**. The molecules in CLB18 can be further divided according to their chemical compositions into three groups containing six structures each. The first group includes hydrocarbons, the second group includes halogen-substituted hydrocarbons, and the third group contains differently substituted carboranes. 

**Table 1.** Molecules contained in the CLB18 database. The reference bond lengths are listed in Å, and they refer to the bond highlighted in red in the corresponding formula.

## CLB18 database results

### Basis set and integration grid effects

Already in 1976, John Pople noticed a good performance of the Hartree–Fock (HF) method with minimal basis sets for geometry optimizations.[@schaefer1977] Since then, many approaches that use small basis sets have been proposed,[@sure2013;@grimme2015;@chan2017] and most evidence indicates that this behavior translates to DFT as well.[@kolos1979;@martin1995;@koch2001;@brothers2006;@buhl2006;@waller2007;@buhl2008;@xu2011;@cramer2013;@fogueri2013a;@chan2016a] As such, molecular structures are usually considered converged at the double-$\zeta$ level. These optimized structures are usually used as the basis for single-point energy calculations with high-accuracy methods and are often included in energetic benchmark databases (see, for example, the BHDIV10 subset in GMTKN55,[@goerigk2017] or some structures in the L7 subset of Hobza et al.).[@sedlak2013] To validate this assumption for the long bonds in CLB18, we explored the basis set convergence of the target bond length of the smallest molecule contained in the database (CLB18_15). We also tested the dependence of the results on the size of the integration grid used to calculate the exchange-correlation energy.

We performed calculations using B3LYP[@becke1988a;@lee1988;@becke1993;@stephens1994] and B3LYP-D3(BJ)[@becke1988a;@lee1988;@becke1993;@stephens1994;@grimme2011] in conjunction with a selection of basis sets of different sizes, with a specific focus on low-cost methods. The selection of basis sets includes two minimal basis sets (STO-3G[@hehre1969;@hehre1970;@pietro1980;@pietro1981] and SBKJC[@binkley1980;@stevens1984;@stevens1992]), as well as 11 double-$\zeta$ basis sets (3-21G,[@binkley1980;@gordon1982;@dobbs1986] 6-31G\*,[@ditchfield1971;@hehre1972;@hariharan1973;@dill1975;@francl1982;@gordon1982;@rassolov2001] def2-SV(P),[@weigend2005] def2-SVP,[@weigend2005] def2-SVPD,[@weigend2005] cc-pVDZ,[@dunning1989;@woon1993;@wilson1999] aug-cc-pVDZ,[@dunning1989;@kendall1992;@woon1993;@wilson1999] pc-0,[@jensen2001;@jensen2002b;@jensen2004b;@jensen2007;@jensen2012] pc-1, [@jensen2001;@jensen2002b;@jensen2004b;@jensen2007;@jensen2012] aug-pc-0, [@jensen2001;@jensen2002b;@jensen2002c;@jensen2004b;@jensen2007;@jensen2012] and aug-pc-1[@jensen2001;@jensen2002b;@jensen2002c;@jensen2004b;@jensen2007;@jensen2012]), and the def2-TZVP,[@weigend2005] def2-TZVPD,[@weigend2005] def2-QZVP,[@weigend2005] and def2-QZVPD[@weigend2005] larger basis sets. These larger sets were primarily used to study the convergence of the results with respect to the number of basis functions since their size renders them cost-prohibitive for larger molecules. The pseudopotential associated with each basis was used for the molecules containing iodine. For the basis sets that do not have an associated pseudopotential, we used the def2 pseudopotential from the corresponding Ahlrichs basis set. Results are reported in **Table 2**. The B3LYP functional shows good convergence of the bond length as a function of the basis set size to a value of 1.880 Å. At the double-$\zeta$ level, most basis sets are within $± 0.003 Å$ of the converged value, an error that is well within 5% of the experimental distance. The B3LYP-D3(BJ) results also show a similar trend, with errors for the bond length obtained with the double-$\zeta$ bases within 3% of the experimental reference.

Interestingly, the convergence with respect to the number of basis function with B3LYP-D3(BJ) is slightly worse than for the bare B3LYP functional, despite a lower absolute error for the bond length. This artifact is due to the semi-empirical -D3(BJ) term, which is correctly reducing the error because of better treatment of dispersion effects, while at the same time complicating the convergence because slightly different parametrizations are used for each basis set. Similar trends are observed for the other molecules in the database and can be seen on the mean signed and mean unsigned errors (MSE and MUE) for the entire CLB18 database, as reported in the Supporting Information (**Section S1**). These results confirm an overall weak dependence of the bond lengths on the basis set size, and support the usage of double-$\zeta$ bases to keep the computational cost under control. Given the historical importance and prevalence in the literature on geometry optimizations, we used the 6-31G\* basis for the remainder of the work. Results with other double-$\zeta$ basis sets are all within 5 mÅ of the 6-31G\* ones (see also **Tables S1** and **S2** in the Supporting Information).

The convergence of the results with respect to the exchange–correlation integration grids is often neglected, but it might be relevant for medium and large molecules. To investigate such an issue, we performed geometry optimizations using five popular Lebedev-Euler-Maclaurin integration grids[@lebedev1975;@lebedev1976;@lebedev1977;@lebedev1999;@murray1993] with the B3LYP and B3LYP-D3(BJ) methods and the 6-31G\* basis set. We report our results in **Table 3** and **Table S4** of the Supporting Information. The grids that we explored are, in order of increasing size: "coarse," with 35 radial and 110 angular points, "SG1 grid",[@gill1993] analogous to a grid with 50 radial and 194 angular points, "fine," with 75 radial and 302 angular points, "ultrafine," with 99 radial and 590 angular, and finally, "superfine," with 175 radial and 974 angular points for hydrogen and 250 radial and 974 angular points for all other elements. 

The convergence of the results with respect to the integration grid is generally a functional-dependent issue, and while meta-GGA functionals usually require finer grids,[@wheeler2009;@johnson2009;@mardirossian2013;@mardirossian2016a] our results on GGA functionals are essentially converged at the fine level, with a substantial saving in computational cost. Based on these results, we chose the fine grid as our grid of choice for all GGA functionals in the remainder of the work, while we opted for the ultrafine grid for all meta-GGA functionals.[@wheeler2009;@johnson2009;@mardirossian2013]

**Table 3** Calculated bond length (in Å) for the CLB18_15 molecule with different integration grids using the B3LYP and B3LYP-D3(BJ) functionals and the 6-31G\* basis set. The computation time (in s) of a single SCF cycle on a single thread is also reported as an estimation of the computational cost of each grid.

### Performance of low-cost computational methods for CLB18

We used the CLB18 database to test the performance of 24 computational methods commonly used for geometry optimizations. Among them, we selected 15 DFT exchange–correlation functional approximations (BLYP,[@becke1988a;@lee1988] BLYP-D3(BJ),[@becke1988a;@lee1988;@grimme2011] BP86,[@becke1988a;@perdew1986] BP86-D3(BJ),[@becke1988a;@perdew1986;@grimme2011] PBE,[@perdew1996] PBE-D3(BJ),[@perdew1996;@grimme2011] B97-D3(BJ),[@grimme2006c;@grimme2011] TPSS-D3(BJ),[@tao2003;@grimme2011] B3LYP,[@becke1988a;@lee1988;@becke1993;@stephens1994] B3LYP-D3(BJ),[@becke1988a;@lee1988;@becke1993;@stephens1994;@grimme2011] PBE0,[@perdew1996;@adamo1999;@ernzerhof1999] PBE0-D3(BJ),[@perdew1996;@adamo1999;@ernzerhof1999;@grimme2011] M06-2X,[@zhao2008] M06-2X-D3(0),[@zhao2008;@goerigk2015] TPSSh-D3(BJ)[@staroverov2003;@grimme2011a]), four semi-empirical Hamiltonian methods (AM1,[@dewar1985] PM3,[@stewart1989;@stewart1989a] PM6,[@stewart2007] PM7[@stewart2013]), two low-cost methods (HF-3c[@sure2013] and PBEh-3c[@grimme2015]), two tight-binding approximations (GFN-xTB1[@grimme2017] and GFN-xTB2[@bannwarth2019]), plus Hartree-Fock (HF).[@hartree1928;@hartree1928a;@fock1930] All calculations have been performed using full geometry optimizations with the Gaussian 16,[@frisch2016] Q-Chem,[@shao2015] or xTB programs,[@bannwarth2020] according to the availability of each method (refer to **Table S5** in Section S3 of the Supporting Information for more details). Following the results presented in the previous section, the 6-31G\*[@ditchfield1971;@hehre1972;@hariharan1973;@dill1975;@francl1982;@gordon1982;@rassolov2001] basis set and the "fine" integration grid (ultrafine for meta-GGA functionals) were used for all functionals except PBEh-3c (the def2-mSVP basis set is defined as part of this method and used here).[@grimme2015] The mean unsigned errors (MUEs) of each method calculated with respect to the 18 experimental reference bond lengths are reported in **Figure 1** below.

**Figure 1** Performance of the 24 approximations on the CLB18 database. All results (in Å) are listed in order of increasing overall MUE. We also reported the MUE for each group of molecules (columns 3–5). The worst result for each method/approximation is reported in bold.

Our results show 14 methods with overall good performance and MUE < 0.1 Å. Among these approximations, the best performers (TPSSh-D3(BJ) and B3LYP-D3(BJ)) have an MUE of  0.017 and 0.018 Å, respectively, followed by seven methods with MUE smaller than 0.04 Å. The accuracy of these methods for the medium-sized molecules in CLB18 is similar to their accuracy for smaller molecules, reported elsewhere.[@peverati2014a;@grimme2015] The Minnesota functionals (M06-2X and M06-2X-D3(0)), as well as the PBEh-3c approximation, the BP86 functional, and the HF method all have acceptable performance for CLB18, with MUEs between 0.040 Å and 0.060 Å. It is worth noting that Grimme and coworkers used a database of 12 molecules having long bonds (LB12) to parametrize the PBEh-3c method,[@grimme2015] in part explaining its good performance. The LB12 database, however, includes bonds that are generally dominated by non-covalent interactions, while CLB18 is composed of mostly covalent bonds. Nevertheless, the accuracy of PBEh-3c for LB12 (0.039 Å) is similar to what we found here for CLB18 (0.049 Å). The remaining ten methods all have an MUE higher than 0.1 Å. The low-cost HF-3c method performs similarly to the tight-binding approximations, which in turn outperforms the semi-empirical Hamiltonian methods. GFN-xTB1 and GFN-xTB2 have been tested against the LB12 dataset as well. Their reported accuracies for LB12 (0.14 and 0.12 Å, respectively)[@bannwarth2019] are once again similar to the results that we obtained for CLB18 (0.11 and 0.10 Å, respectively). Surprisingly, we also found three DFT functionals that perform worse than the semi-empirical methods, namely B97-D3(BJ), BLYP-D3(BJ), and BLYP. The poor performance of these functionals can be attributed to high errors in structure CLB18_5 and structure CLB18_6, which both belong to group 1, and for which all other methods have no issues. We also notice that all the dispersion-corrected functionals besides M06-2X-D3(0) perform better than their uncorrected counterparts, in line with previous findings and recommendations.[@goerigk2017;@mardirossian2017] Analyzing the performance for the three constituent groups, it is interesting to note that the carborane molecules (group 3) are the most problematic structures for the vast majority of the methods.

## Comparison with other databases

The results presented in the previous section show that most of the best performers for the CLB18 database have a percentage of HF exchange of 25% or lower. Such behavior is not uncommon, and it is found, for example, when describing the energetics of metal-organic interactions, such as in the study of spin states of transition-metal complexes.[@reiher2001;@kepp2013;@siig2018;@cirera2018] For example, Reiher and coworkers found that decreasing the percentage of HF exchange in the B3LYP functional from 20 to 15% improves its performance for spin states.[@reiher2001] Kepp, Cirera, and coworkers identified TPSSh—a functional containing 10% of HF exchange—as the best performer for spin states in spin-crossover complexes.[@kepp2013;@siig2018;@cirera2018] Although CLB18 exclusively contains structural data, the fact that TPSSh and B3LYP are the top two performers might suggest a connection between the effects that are necessary to describe the structure of C–C long bonds in CLB18 and the energetics of metal-organic interactions.

Similarly, a percentage of HF exchange above 40% seems detrimental to the performance on CLB18. This finding is also unexpected since functionals with a higher percentage of HF exchange (such as M06-2X and PBEh-3c) are usually suggested for calculations on systems with partially dissociated bonds, such as transition states optimization for barrier heights. In this section, we explore the potential connection between the information contained in CLB18 and those in other databases that are commonly used for the benchmark and parametrization of computational methods.

### Effect of the Hartree-Fock exchange, multi-reference character, and comparison with metal-organic interactions

To further understand the effect of the percentage of HF exchange on the results of CLB18, we started from the PBE0 functional form:

$ 
E_{\text{xc}}^{\text{PBE0}}=\lambda E_{\text{HF}}+ (1-\lambda) E_{\text{x}}^{\text{PBE}} + E_{\text{c}}^{\text{PBE}},
$ 

and we increased the percentage of HF exchange ($\lambda$) from 0 to 100% in increments of 10%. We used the resulting functionals to perform full geometry optimization on the entire CLB18 database. These results are visually summarized in **Figure 2**. The curve for the overall MUE as a function of the percentage of HF exchange shows an optimal value of around 15%. The minima for each constituent group fall within a range between 10 and 20%, with slight differences: Group 1 minimum is at 20%, group 2 minimum is at 10%, while group 3 minimum is at 15%. With percentages of HF exchange higher than 30%, the performance deteriorates significantly. Above the 35% threshold, the overall mean unsigned error of the resulting hybrid functional becomes higher than local PBE (0.040 Å), while above the 50% threshold, it becomes worse than HF (0.061 Å). This fact explains, for example, the unexpectedly bad performance of M06-2X and PBEh-3c, which have 54 and 42% HF exchange, respectively.

Performance for the three constituents group are also reported (orange, dashed: group 1; blue, dotted: group 2, green, dot-dashed: group 3). The data used to generate this figure can be found in **Figure S1** in the Supporting Information.

A long bond length might be electronically similar to a partially dissociated bond, therefore entailing some degree of strong correlation that requires a multi-reference (MR) treatment. For molecules that exhibit MR character, the use of either local or hybrid functionals with a small percentage of exact exchange is usually recommended[@perdew1996a;@furche2006;@cramer2009] since modeling the overall exchange–correlation hole with a local density-dependent functional is superior to using (a portion of) the exact exchange hole in conjunction with a density-dependent correlation functional.[@baerends1997;@gritsenko1997;@perdew2005;@perdew2008a;@bruggemann2020] The results reported in **Figure 2** appear consistent with this picture. To establish whether the molecules in the CLB18 database exhibit MR character or not, we used the $A_\lambda$ diagnostic of Martin and coworkers (more details in the Supporting Information, Section S4).[@fogueri2013] The calculated values of $A_{\lambda}$ for most molecules are essentially constant with respect to changes of $\lambda$, with the only exception of CLB18_16 (see **Figure S1** in the Supporting Information). In addition, all values besides those of CLB18_16 are within the limits of the unproblematic cases set by Fogueri et al.[@fogueri2013] at $A_{\lambda} < 0.10$. These results indicate—perhaps surprisingly—that most of the molecules in CLB18 do not require an MR treatment. For CLB18_16, it is not clear if this structure exhibits MR character, but we did not observe any bias in the overall results because of its inclusion. The optimal performance of hybrid functionals with a low percentage of HF exchange for CLB18 is not due to intrinsic strong correlation in the molecules, but it must be attributed to more subtle exchange–correlation effects that are harder to quantify. 

Despite the apparent chemical differences, the character of the electronic interactions in CLB18  resembles that in spin states of transition-metal complexes. Both situations contain systems that are mostly non-MR but favor a lower percentage of HF exchange.[@reiher2001;@kepp2013;@siig2018;@cirera2018]

### Comparison with transient long bonds

It is also interesting to explore if CLB18 provides information similar to other databases with stretched bonds. To explore this potential analogy, we performed transition state searches to optimize the structures of the molecules in the BH76 database [@zhao2005;@zhao2005b;@zheng2009;@peverati2014a] using 22 of the methods used for the CLB18 database. We did not include the GFN-xTB1 and GFN-xTB2 methods because their application to very small molecules such as those in BH76 is not recommended, and also because a reliable transition-state search algorithm is not implemented in the programs that we have available for these calculations. While several barrier heights databases are included in major database collections,[@mardirossian2017;@goerigk2017;@yu2015b;@yu2016;@yu2016a;@morgante2019a;@morgante2019b] the geometries of the transition structures of most of them are reported at the DFT level and cannot be used for our current purpose (see **Table S7** in the Supporting Information). The BH76 database includes very small molecules exclusively, with transition states optimized at the QCISD/MG3 level of theory.[@pople1987;@krishnan1980;@mclean1980;@clark1983;@frisch1984;@curtiss1998a;@fast1999;@lynch2003] Despite a noticeable difference in size between BH76 and CLB18, the former is currently the only barrier heights database with reference transition states structures that can be used as a structural benchmark.

Since the differences in geometries in the BH76 can not be evaluated using just a single bond length, we calculated the average of the root-mean-square gradients of the energy (ARMSG) at the reference molecular structure for each method. This number can be used as a surrogate to geometric performance. The gradient should be zero at each reference transition state. As such, the larger the ARMSG gradient is, the further the method predicts the transition state from that reference structure, the larger the error. Results are reported in **Figure 3**, alongside the MUE for CLB18 copied from **Figure1**.

**Figure 3** Comparison of the performance of the functionals on the CLB18 (MUE) and BH76 (ARMSG) databases. A green background indicates satisfactory performance, while a red background indicates poor performance. 

A few general conclusions can be drawn from the data in **Figure 3**. For example, functionals that generally perform well for CLB18—such as TPSSh-D3(BJ), B3LYP-D3(BJ), and PBE0—also have a good performance on the geometries of the BH76 database. At the same time, functionals that perform poorly for CLB18—BLYP-D3(BJ), B97-D3(BJ), and BLYP—are also bad performers against BH76. However, we can also notice that the top performers for CLB18 (TPSSh-D3(BJ), B3LYP-D3(BJ)) are only average performers for BH76. The same is true for the top performers for BH76 (PBEh-3c, M06-2X, and M06-2X-D3(0)), which are only moderately good for CLB18. Looking at these functionals in terms of the percentage of HF exchange, it appears that a higher $\lambda$ is detrimental to the performance for CLB18, while it seems to provide the best performance for BH76. These results suggest that the bonds in the CLB18 database are electronically different from the stretched bonds in the transition structures of the BH76 database. It is important to stress that while the former are minima structures in the corresponding potential energy surface, the latter are saddle point structures. This radically different nature might explain the discrepancies that are observed in the exchange–correlation effects. To further investigate the issue, we also calculated the optimal percentage of HF exchange for all the molecules in BH76 and the $A_\lambda$ MR diagnostics. Results are reported in **Figure 4** and **Table S8** in the Supporting Information.

**Figure 4** Effect of the HF exchange on the performance of the PBE0 functional for the BH76 database. The data used to generate this figure can be found in **Figure S2** in the Supporting Information.

The overall behavior of BH76 as a function of the percentage of HF exchange shows a minimum of 40%, a value that is drastically different from the optimal value for CLB18. In general, the best performances for BH76 are achieved by functionals with percentages of HF exchange between 30 and 50%, such as with M06-2X and PBEh-3c. This is also consistent with the fact that exact exchange is needed to improve the performance on barrier heights. [@sadhukhan1999;@zhao2005;@zhao2005a;@zhao2008;@mahler2017;@mahler2018] Noticeably, we can now add the important information that high percentages of HF exchange are required for describing both energies and geometries of transition states. Such a high optimal percentage of HF exchange is even more surprising considering that the $A_\lambda$ diagnostic indicates that the structures in BH76 are more MR than those in CLB18. Given the higher MR character in BH76, one might naively expect a functional with a lower percentage of HF exchange to be more suitable, but this is not observed from the data. These results prove that the simple suggestion of using functionals with a low percentage of HF exchange for potentially MR cases and using functionals with a high percentage of HF exchange for non-MR cases—while statistically motivated—is not valid in general.

## Conclusions

In this Letter, we have introduced the CLB18 database of 18 large molecules having long C–C bonds, and we used it to benchmark the performance of 24 computational methods commonly used for geometry optimizations. Our results show that DFT exchange–correlation functionals with a low percentage of HF exchange are the best performers for CLB18. Comparison with results from other databases—including the BH76 databases of barrier heights—suggests that the long bonds in CLB18 are electronically different from the elongated bonds in transition structures. The ingredients for success in describing the long bonds in CLB18 are similar to those required to describe the energetics of spin states in transition-metal complexes. We also report other indicators that point towards a correlation between these two seemingly different properties. As such, CLB18 represents a valuable tool for the parametrization of new electronic structure methods with broader chemical applicability.
