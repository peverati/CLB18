Students are able to apply concepts of symmetry, polarizability, and molecular dipoles to the analysis of experimental and computational data. A laboratory activity combining experimental infrared (IR) and Raman spectra, computational DFT methods, and analysis provides students with the ability to analyze how molecular structure and symmetry influence vibrational spectra.},

  abstract = {Quantum-mechanical methods are widely used for understanding molecular interactions throughout biology, chemistry, and materials science. Quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] are two state-of-the-art and trusted wavefunction methods that have been categorically shown to yield accurate interaction energies for small organic molecules. These methods provide valuable reference information for widely-used semi-empirical and machine learning potentials, especially where experimental information is scarce. However, agreement for systems beyond small molecules is a crucial remaining milestone for cementing the benchmark accuracy of these methods. Approaching such well-converged predictive power in larger molecules has motivated major developments in CCSD(T) as well as DMC algorithms in the past years, resulting in orders of magnitude time-to-solution reductions. Here, we show that CCSD(T) and DMC interaction energies are not in consistent agreement for a set of polarizable supramolecules. Whilst agreement is found for some of the complexes, in a few key systems disagreements of up to 8 kcal/mol remained. This leads to differences of up to 6 orders of magnitude in the corresponding binding association constant at room temperature for systems which are well within the accustomed domain of applicability for both methods. These findings thus indicate that more caution is required when aiming at reproducible non-covalent interactions between extended molecules. Our data contradicts the expectation that the most comprehensive and robust wavefunction methods predict identical non-covalent interactions and indicate an unsolved challenge for benchmark approaches.},

Despite its prominence early in the organic chemistry curriculum, the exact mechanism of this reaction is still under debate, and this controversy is often neglected in the classroom. Introducing a simple computational study of the Wittig reaction illustrates the mechanistic uncertainty in this reaction and also demonstrates the use of computational methods in chemistry. This exercise is designed to be used with the Hyperchem software package, but can easily be adapted to other applications, both commercial and freeware. Learning outcomes focus on specific details of the Wittig reaction, the uncertainty of reaction mechanisms in general, and thermodynamic aspects of reactions.},

Upon light irradiation (500 nm), the azopyridine moiety induces a change in the Ni(               ii               ) coordination sphere from square planar (               n               = 4) to square pyramid (               n               = 5), leading to a change in the total spin of the molecule from               S               = 0 to               S               = 1. The               trans\textendash cis               isomerization in the azopyridine ligand has been proposed to trigger the spin-crossover effect.

  abstract = {Fe(II)-porphyrins (FeP) play an important role in many reactions relevant to material science and biological processes, due to their closely lying spin states. However, this small energetic separation also makes it challenging to establish the correct spin state ordering. Although the prevalent opinion is that these systems posses the triplet ground state, the recent experiment on Fe(II)-phthalocyanine under conditions matching those of an isolated molecule points toward the quintet ground state. We present a thorough study of FeP model by means of the density functional theory and density matrix renormalization group based tailored coupled clusters, in which we address all previously discussed correlation effects. We examine the importance of geometrical parameters, the Fe-N distances in particular, and conclude that the system possesses the quintet ground state, which is in our calculations well-separated from the triplet state.},

  abstract = {The electrophilic addition of a hydrohalic acid (HX) to an alkene is often one of the first reactions learned in second-year undergraduate organic chemistry classes. During the ensuing discussion of the mechanism, it is shown that this reaction follows Markovnikov's rule, which states that the hydrogen atom will attach to the carbon with fewer substituents while the halogen atom will attach to the carbon with more substituents. However, in the preparation of tropic acid, the reaction of HCl with atropic acid (2phenylpropenoic acid) does not follow this rule because it is a conjugated system. Molecular modeling of the possible carbocation intermediates suggests that the reaction follows a conjugate addition mechanism involving a 1,4-addition of HCl across the conjugated alkene and carboxyl group rather than addition across the alkene as students often first propose. PM3 semiempirical calculations are used to determine the energies of three possible carbocation intermediates. The energies obtained from the modeling suggest that the carbocation intermediate produced by the 1,4-addition is the most stable.},

In this proof-of-concept paper, we present a theoretical approach to rationalize and predict the change in chemical properties and concepts when an external stretching force,               F               ext               , is applied to a chemical bond. By considering perturbations to the total molecular energy due to               F               ext               , a series of mechanochemical response indices are obtained within the framework of conceptual density functional theory (DFT). Trends in these indices monitoring the change in hardness and electrophilicity among others, were rationalized for a number of diatomic molecules in terms of the ground-state geometry and the frontier molecular orbitals of the molecule. Finally, we present a set of rules that can be easily adopted for polyatomic molecules to predict the changing chemical reactivity of single molecules when subjected to an external force.},

  abstract = {This review describes progress in the field of artificial switchable catalysts, where the rate acceleration, stereochemistry and/or chemoselectivity of catalysed processes can be switched through external stimuli.           ,              Catalysis is key to the effective and efficient transformation of readily available building blocks into high value functional molecules and materials. For many years research in this field has largely focussed on the invention of new catalysts and the optimization of their performance to achieve high conversions and/or selectivities. However, inspired by Nature, chemists are beginning to turn their attention to the development of catalysts whose activity in different chemical processes can be switched by an external stimulus. Potential applications include using the states of multiple switchable catalysts to control sequences of transformations, producing different products from a pool of building blocks according to the order and type of stimuli applied. Here we outline the state-of-art in artificial switchable catalysis, classifying systems according to the trigger used to achieve control over the catalytic activity and stereochemical or other structural outcomes of the reaction.},

In this context, the crystal structure of               1               as well as the crystal structure of the very weak adduct               1               {$\cdot$}               NCMe               was determined.

The individual ion affinities were then assessed based on subsequent isodesmic reactions calculated at a much less expensive level (RI-)BP86/SV(P). This method was validated by systematic calculations of smaller reference systems at the frozen core CCSD(T) level with correlation effects extrapolated to a full quadruple-{$\zeta$} basis. Overall, 33 common and frequently used Lewis acids were ranked with respect to their FIA, CIA, HIA and MIA (fluoride/chloride/hydride/methyl ion affinity).},

  abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing (bio)organic and organometallic systems and proved remarkably accurate in computing the small free energy differences that underpin many chemical phenomena (e.g. regio- and stereoselective reactions). We show that the lack of rotational invariance of popular DFT integration grids reveals large uncertainties in computed free energies for some isomerizations, torsional barriers, and regio- and stereoselective reactions. The result is that predictions based on DFT-computed free energies for systems with very lowfrequency vibrational modes can change qualitatively depending on molecular orientation. For example, for a metal-free propargylation of benzaldehyde, predicted enantioselectivities based on B97-D/def2-TZVP free energies using a popular pruned (75,302) integration grid can vary from 62:38 to 99:1 by simply rotating the transition state structures. Relative free energies for the regiocontrolling transition state structures for an Ir-catalyzed C\textendash H functionalization reaction computed using M06/631G(d,p)/LANL2DZ and the same grid can vary by more than 5 kcal mol\textendash 1, resulting in predicted regioselectivities that range anywhere from 14:86 to {$>$}99:1. Errors of these magnitudes occur for different functionals and basis sets, are potentially widespread among modern applications of DFT, and can be reduced by using much denser integration grids than commonly employed.},

  abstract = {{$<$}div{$>$}Applications of density functionaltheory (DFT) in computational chemistry rely on an approximate exchange-correlation (xc) functional. However, existing approximations can fail dramatically for open-shell molecules, in particular for transition-metal complexes or radicals. Most importantly, predicting energy-differences between different spin-states with approximate exchange-correlation functionals remains extremely challenging. Formally, it is known that the exact xc functional should be spin-state dependent, but none of the available approximations features such an explicit spin-state dependence [Ch.\textasciitilde R.\textasciitilde Jacob, M.\textasciitilde Reiher, \textbackslash textit\{Int. J. Quantum Chem.\}, 2012, \textbackslash textbf\{112\}, 3661\textendash 3684]. Thus, to find novel approximations for the xc functional for open-shell systems, the development of spin-state dependent xc functionals appears to be a promising avenue.  Here, we set out to shed light on the spin-state dependence of the xc functional by investigating the underlying xc holes, which we extract from configuration interaction calculations for model systems. We analyze the similarities and differences between the xc holes of the lowest-energy singlet and triplet states of the dihydrogen molecule, the helium atom, and the lithium dimer. To shed further light on the spin-state dependence of these xc holes we also discuss exact conditions that can be derived from the spin structure of the reduced two-electron density matrix. Altogether, our results suggest several possible routes towards the construction of explicitly spin-state dependent approximations for the xc functional.{$<$}br{$><$}/div{$><$}br{$>$}},

  abstract = {The so-called D4 model is presented for the accurate computation of London dispersion interactions in density functional theory approximations (DFT-D4) and generally for atomistic modeling methods. In this successor to the DFT-D3 model, the atomic coordination-dependent dipole polarizabilities are scaled based on atomic partial charges which can be taken from various sources. For this purpose, a new charge-dependent parameter-economic scaling function is designed. Classical charges are obtained from an atomic electronegativity equilibration procedure for which efficient analytical derivatives with respect to nuclear positions are developed. A numerical Casimir-Polder integration of the atom-in-molecule dynamic polarizabilities then yields charge- and geometry-dependent dipoledipole dispersion coefficients. Similar to the D3 model, the dynamic polarizabilities are precomputed by time-dependent DFT and all elements up to radon (Z = 86) are covered. The two-body dispersion energy expression has the usual sum-over-atom-pairs form and includes dipole-dipole as well as dipole-quadrupole interactions. For a benchmark set of 1225 molecular dipole-dipole dispersion coefficients, the D4 model achieves an unprecedented accuracy with a mean relative deviation of 3.8\% compared to 4.7\% for D3. In addition to the two-body part, three-body effects are described by an Axilrod-Teller-Muto term. A common many-body dispersion expansion was extensively tested, and an energy correction based on D4 polarizabilities is found to be advantageous for larger systems. BeckeJohnson-type damping parameters for DFT-D4 are determined for more than 60 common density functionals. For various standard energy benchmark sets, DFT-D4 slightly but consistently outperforms DFT-D3. Especially for metal containing systems, the introduced charge dependence of the dispersion coefficients improves thermochemical properties. We suggest (DFT-)D4 as a physically improved and more sophisticated dispersion model in place of DFT-D3 for DFT calculations as well as other low-cost approaches like semi-empirical models.},

  abstract = {Different DFT methods give relative energies for models of the FeMo cluster in nitrogenase that differ by up to 600 kJ mol               -1               . This is 4\textendash 30 times more than what is observed for other systems and explain why previous computational studies have given conflicting results. It is caused by differences in the oxidation state of the metals and the number of Fe\textendash C, Fe\textendash S and Fe\textendash H bonds, connected to the amount of static correlation.                        ,                             Nitrogenase is the only enzyme that can cleave the triple bond in N               2               , making nitrogen avaiable for other organisms. It contains a complicated MoFe               7               S               9               C(homocitrate) cluster in its active site. Many computational studies with density-functional theory (DFT) of the nitrogenase enzyme have been presented, but they do not show any consensus \textendash{} they do not even agree where the first four protons should be added, forming the central intermediate E               4               . We show that the prime reason for this is that different DFT methods give relative energies that differ by almost 600 kJ mol               -1               for different protonation states. This is 4\textendash 30 times more than what is observed for other systems. The reason for this is that in some structures, the hydrogens bind to sulfide or carbide ions as protons, whereas in other structures they bind to the metals as hydride ions, changing the oxidation state of the metals, as well as the Fe\textendash C, Fe\textendash S and Fe\textendash Fe distances. The energies correlate with the amount of Hartree\textendash Fock exchange in the method, indicating a variation in the amount of static correlation in the structures. It is currently unclear which DFT method gives the best results for nitrogenase. We show that non-hybrid DFT functionals and TPSSh give the most accurate structures of the resting active site, whereas B3LYP and PBE0 give the best H               2               dissociation energies. However, no DFT method indicates that a structure of E               4               with two bridging hydride ions is lowest in energy, as spectroscopic experiments indicate.},

  abstract = {We have obtained benchmark data for a set of small molecular systems of Cu, Ag, and Au using coupledcluster methods. Using this collection of reference data (that we termed the CUAGAU set) for assessing DFT-type methods, we find the MN15-L nonhybrid DFT to be costeffective for geometry optimization [mean absolute deviation (MAD) in bond length = 0.20 \AA ], with an accuracy that is comparable to that for the double-hybrid (DH) DFT method DSD-PBEP86 (MAD = 0.19 \AA ). For the computation of thermochemical properties, among ``conventional'' (non-MP2based) DFT methods, the best performance is found for the global-hybrid meta-GGA functional MN15, with an MAD of 11.4 kJ mol-1. We also find the nonhybrid method B97M-rV to have a reasonable performance (MAD = 14.4 kJ mol-1), and it may serve as a cost-effective means for qualitative study. If we look beyond conventional functionals, we find DSD-PBEP86 (MAD = 7.3 kJ mol-1) to be more accurate than even MN15. Nonetheless, this level of accuracy is still not sufficient for quantitative studies. In this regard, high-level wave function methods such as composite procedures that are based on coupled cluster are still indispensable for obtaining reliable reference data for transition-metal species.},

It comprises diatomic dissociation energies and reaction energies and barriers for prototypical transition-metal reactions. Our assessment of a diverse range of different types of DFT methods shows that the most accurate functionals include {$\omega$}B97MV, {$\omega$}B97X-V, MN15, and B97M-rV. Notably, they have also been previously validated to be highly robust for main-group chemistry. Nevertheless, even these methods show substantially worse accuracies for transition metals than for main-group chemistry. For less accurate methods, there is not a good correlation between their accuracies for main-group and transition-metal chemistries. Thus, in the development of new DFT, it is important to assess the accuracies for both types of data. In this regard, we have formulated the TMC34 model for efficient assessment of the performance for transition metals, which complements our previously developed MG8 model for main-group chemistry. Together, they provide a cost-effective means for initial assessment of new methodologies.},

Using the hybrid meta-GGA exchange\textendash correlation functional TPSSh, accurate values for the thermochemical quantities associated with the different spin-states can be computed, and subsequently used to calculate the corresponding transition temperatures. This result also allows for the correct modeling of the spin-crossover curve, in agreement with the two-step or single-step nature experimentally reported for the transition. Our results indicate that the presence or absence of a two-step transition is mostly dominated by electronic effects, and the cooperativity between binding pockets plays a minor role. Insight on the electronic structure effects that enhance or suppress this behavior and its origin can be outlined from direct analysis of the relevant d-based molecular orbitals, which allows for a quantitative computational prediction to screen for new dinuclear systems with selected properties.},

Computational chemistry and molecular-modeling procedures may be applied to predict some of these same properties. We describe experiments suited for the undergraduate instructional laboratory in which the heats of formation of several compounds are calculated using semiempirical procedures. Three semiempirical models, AM1, MNDO, and PM3, were evaluated. In general PM3 proved most successful in its ability to predict the heats of formation of the energetic compounds studied when compared to experimental data. Cubane was an exception. The calculated heat of formation (474.97 kJ͞mol) of this highly strained aliphatic compound was substantially less than the experimentally determined (622.2 kJ͞mol) value. Semiempirical (PM3) calculations for octanitrocubane, a new high explosive, predicted a heat of formation of 552.7 kJ͞mol. This value is within the rather broad range (339\textendash 728 kJ͞mol) calculated by others using a variety of procedures. However, it is substantially less than presumably more accurate values calculated using an isodesmic approach coupled with density functional theory.},

As such, it is important that undergraduate chemistry students develop competence in this emerging field of chemistry. One strategy to gain proficiency involves exposing students to computational methods of increasing depth and complexity during each year of their laboratory curriculum, rather than solely at late stages of their education. The computational chemistry exercises described herein are designed to be completed in one introductory-level organic chemistry laboratory period, and they build upon concepts covered in traditional organic lecture and lab curricula. Students generate electrostatic potential maps for substituted acetic acids to analyze bond polarity and pKa, model acetate to explore resonance, and conduct conformation searches for monosubstituted cyclohexanes to examine the influence of sterics on conformational preference. They also generate reaction coordinate diagrams for substitution and elimination reactions between 2-bromobutane and various alkoxide bases. Students are asked to examine the energetics of starting materials, possible products, and theoretical transition states. All aspects of the exercises align with traditional topics, and thus reinforce their significance.},

This new theoretical procedure adds three features to G1 theory [J. Chem. Phys. 90, 5622 (1989)] including a correction for nonadditivity of diffuse-sp and 2df basis set extensions, a basis set extension containing a third d function on nonhydrogen and a second p function on hydrogen atoms, and a modification of the higher level correction. G2 theory is a significant improvement over G1 theory because it eliminates a number of deficiencies present in G1 theory. Of particular importance is the improvement in atomization energies of ionic molecules such as LiF and hydrides such as C2H6, NH3, N2H4, H2O2, and CH3SH. The average absolute deviation from experiment of atomization energies of 39 first-row compounds...},

The relatively modest increase in the computational cost between explicit and conventional CCSD(T) is more than compensated for by the impressive accuracy of the CCSD(T)-F12 method.

  abstract = {For dealing with atoms involving many electrons the accurate quantum theory, involving a solution of the wave equation in many-dimensional space, is far too complicated to be practicable. One must therefore resort to approximate methods. The best of these is Hartree's method of the self-consistent field. Even this, however, is hardly practicable when one has to deal with very many electrons, so that one then requires a still simpler and rougher method. Such a method is provided by Thomas' atomic model, in which the electrons are regarded as forming a perfect gas satisfying the Fermi statistics and occupying the region of phase space of lowest energy. This region of phase space is assumed to be saturated, with two electrons with opposite spins in each volume (2{$\pi$}               h               )               3               , and the remainder is assumed to be empty. Although this model hitherto has not been justified theoretically, it seems to be a plausible approximation for the interior of a heavy atom and one may expect it to give with some accuracy the distribution of electric charge there.},

Both non-relativistic and relativistic systems are treated. The connection of density functional theory with other many-body methods is highlighted.

  abstract = {Advances in software and hardware have promoted the use of computational chemistry in all branches of chemical research to probe important chemical concepts and to support experimentation. Consequently, it has become imperative that students in the modern undergraduate curriculum become adept at performing simple calculations using computational software, interpreting computational data, and applying computational data to explain chemical phenomena. We utilize computational chemistry in a high-enrollment ({$>$}1200 students/year), undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory course in a manner similar to that of organic chemistry researchers. We have employed WebMO as a webbased, easy-to-use, and free front-end interface for Gaussian09 that allows our students to complete ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) calculations throughout the curriculum. Rather than an isolated exposure to computational chemistry, our students use computational chemistry to obtain a deeper understanding of their experimental work throughout the entire semester. By integrating calculations into the curriculum, the focus moves away from performing the calculations to providing insight into chemical phenomena and understanding experimental results. We provide here both an overview of the introductory laboratory experiment and our integrated approach.},

  abstract = {Abstract A role for electronic structure databases in assisting users of quantum chemistry applications select better model parameters is discussed in light of experiences gained from a software prototype known as the Computational Chemistry Input Assistant (CCIA). It is argued that the ready availability of information pertaining to the applications and theoretical models can substantially increase the likelihood of novice users obtaining the desired accuracy from their calculations while simultaneously making better use of computer resources. Expert users, who find themselves contemplating studies in new areas of research, may also benefit from the proposed tools. For maximum impact, this assistance should be provided while users are actively engaged in preparing calculations. \textcopyright{} 1996 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {In the present work the intermolecular BSSE, associated to the A\textendash B interaction, is obtained by subtracting the intramolecular BSSE of the fragments from the intramolecular BSSE of the supermolecule, and considering every atom as a fragment in the calculation of each intramolecular BSSE. This atom by atom scheme (CPaa) is based on the consideration that the proximity of the fragments may affect the intramolecular BSSE of every involved species, and artificially influences the value of the BSSE associated to the supermolecule formation. It drastically decreases the reported counterpoise overcorrection of the A\textendash B interaction, even though it does not deal with all the overcorrection because it includes all the orbitals, and not only the unoccupied ones. This new approach has been tested on the water dimer, some hydrogen fluoride weakly bonded complexes, the conformational analysis of 1,2-dichloroethane, and the reaction profile of formaldehyde \th{} OH reaction.},

  abstract = {Among computational methods, DFT (density functional theory) and TD-DFT (time-dependent DFT) are widely used in research to describe, inter alia, the optical properties of transition metal complexes. Inorganic/physical chemistry courses for undergraduate students treat such methods, but quite often only from the theoretical point of view. In the calculation exercise herein described, students are guided step by step through the computational study of the photophysics and photochemistry of polypyridyl Ru(II) d6-metal complexes. In particular, by means of DFT and TD-DFT calculations, they are asked to examine and interpret a set of experimental data describing the absorption, emission, and photochemical behavior of three structurally related ruthenium complexes, namely, [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (1), [Ru(tpy)2]2+ (2), and [Ru(bpy)2(py)2]2+ (3). These complexes are particularly suitable for an educational purpose since they exhibit distinct optical and photochemical properties despite being structurally akin to each other. In the computational chemistry laboratory, the instructor progressively guides students through the preparation of DFT and TD-DFT inputs and the use of software for the analysis of output files, including visualization of optimized geometries, absorption spectra, orbitals, and spin density surfaces. The exercise covers training of students in several key concepts concerning the photophysics and photochemistry of transition metal complexes. These include Franck-Condon transitions and the role of 3MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) and 3MC (metal-centered or ligand-field) states in luminescence and ligand photodissociation processes. Notably, the mixed character of this exercise allows its integration with theoretical and experimental activities and the design of truly multidisciplinary courses.},

The students use simulated annealing, or the genetic algorithm, to find the globally optimized binding energies and structures of the Ne and Ar clusters. They employ the liquid drop model to extrapolate the cluster binding energies to the solid state and compare the result with the experimental cohesive energy of the rare gas solid. A Windows-based application is provided that allows students to explore the energetic and structural properties of the rare gas clusters. Students encounter the ``magic numbers'', for example, N = 13, 55, and others, associated with clusters that have higher-than-expected binding energies arising from enhanced nearest-neighbor interactions. They also estimate the solid density of each element from the size of the model cubic cluster (N = 14) that represents the face-centered unit cell.},

  abstract = {We present a quantum chemistry benchmark database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions (GMTKN24). It is an unprecedented compilation of 24 different, chemically relevant subsets that either are taken from already existing databases or are presented here for the first time. The complete set involves a total of 1.049 atomic and molecular single point calculations and comprises 731 data points (relative chemical energies) based on accurate theoretical or experimental reference values. The usefulness of the GMTKN24 database is shown by applying common density functionals on the (meta-)generalized gradient approximation (GGA), hybrid-GGA, and double-hybrid-GGA levels to it, including an empirical London dispersion correction. Furthermore, we refitted the functional parameters of four (meta-)GGA functionals based on a fit set containing 143 systems, comprising seven chemically different problems. Validation against the GMTKN24 and the molecular structure (bond lengths) databases shows that the reparameterization does not change bond lengths much, whereas the description of energetic properties is more prone to the parameters' values. The empirical dispersion correction also often improves for conventional thermodynamic problems and makes a functional's performance more uniform over the entire database. The refitted functionals typically have a lower mean absolute deviation for the majority of subsets in the proposed GMTKN24 set. This, however, is also often accompanied at the expense of poor performance, for a few other important subsets. Thus, creating a broadly applicable (and overall better) functional by just reparameterizing existing ones seems to be difficult. Nevertheless, this benchmark study reveals that a reoptimized (i.e., empirical) version of the TPSS-D functional (oTPSS-D) performs well for a variety of problems and may meet the standards of an improved functional. We propose validation against this new compilation of benchmark sets as a definitive way to evaluate a new quantum chemical method's true performance.},

  abstract = {For years, there has been ongoing interest in experimentally and theoretically understanding inversion and racemization processes. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no computational study that systematically investigated how well low-level quantum-chemical methods predict inversion barriers. Herein, we provide an answer to this question and we present the INV24 benchmark set of 24 high-level, ab initio inversion barriers. INV24 covers inversion in triatomics, in pyramidal molecules, in one cyclic system, and in various helical and bowl-shaped compounds. Our results indicate that previously applied DFT approximations combined with small basis sets are not reliable enough and that at least a triple-{$\zeta$} basis is needed for meaningful results. Moreover, we show that intramolecular London dispersion influences the barriers by 2 kcal/mol or more and that dispersion corrections should always be applied to DFT results. With our analysis of 34 DFT approximations, we can reproduce the well-known Jacob's Ladder scheme with (meta-)generalized-gradient-approximation methods underestimating barriers and global-hybrid DFT functionals performing better. Range-separated hybrids or Minnesota-type hybrids are not particularly superior to more conventional methods, such as B3LYP-D3. The by far best results are achieved with dispersion-corrected double hybrids, which give results below the chemical accuracy target of 1 kcal/mol. They also outperform wave-function second-order perturbation theory approaches and we recommend using them whenever possible. Given that our systematic study of INV24 is the first of its kind, our findings have the potential to change common practice in this field and they will guide future investigations of inversion processes.},

Its main emphasis lies on how to find a way through the confusing `zoo' of DFT by addressing common misconceptions and highlighting those modern methods that should ideally be used in calculations of energetic properties and geometries. A particular focus is on highly popular methods and the important fact that popularity does not imply accuracy. In this context, we present a new analysis of the openly available data published in Swart and co-workers' famous annual `DFT poll' (http://www.marcelswart.eu/dft-poll/) to demonstrate the existing communication gap between the DFT user and developer communities. We show that despite considerable methodological advances in the field, the perception of some parts of the user community regarding their favourite approaches has changed little. It is hoped that this account makes a contribution towards changing this status and that users are inspired to adjust their current computational protocols to accommodate strategies that are based on proven robustness, accuracy, and efficiency rather than popularity.},

The valence functions for the smaller representation (3-21G) have been taken directly from the larger (6-21G), preventing their collapse inwards to make up for deficiencies in the inner-shell region. This is necessary to ensure a good description of bonding interactions which necessarily involve overlap of valence functions. Equilibrium geometries, vibrational frequencies, relative energies, and electric dipole moments calculated with the use of the 3-21G basis set for a number of molecules containing second-row atoms are nearly identical with those obtained from the larger 6-21G representation. Compared to experiment they are consistently superior to properties derived from the STO-3G minimal basis set, and of comparable quality to those obtained from the larger 4-31G split-valence representation. The 3-21G basis set comprises the same number of primitive Gaussian functions as STO-3G (although a significantly greater number of basis functions), and should be nearly as efficient computationally as that representation for applications which require evaluation of energy derivatives as well as the energy itself (e.g., determination of equilibrium geometry and calculation of vibrational frequencies). It is significantly less costly to apply than the 4-31G basis set, and would appear to be the method of choice for split-valence level Hartree-Fock calculations on moderately sized molecules.},

  abstract = {A new double hybrid density functional (PWRB95) based on GGA orbitals and RPA is presented and its performance is investigated compared to standard DFT and wavefunction methods.           ,                             We present a revised form of a double hybrid density functional (DHDF) dubbed PWRB95. It contains semi-local Perdew\textendash Wang exchange and Becke95 correlation with a fixed amount of 50\% non-local Fock exchange. New features are that the robust random phase approximation (RPA) is used to calculate the non-local correlation part instead of a second-order perturbative treatment as in standard DHDF, and the non-self-consistent evaluation of the Fock exchange with KS-orbitals at the GGA level which leads to a significant reduction of the computational effort. To account for London dispersion effects we include the non-local VV10 dispersion functional. Only three empirical scaling parameters were adjusted. The PWRB95 results for extensive standard thermochemical benchmarks (GMTKN30 data base) are compared to those of well-known functionals from the classes of (meta-)GGAs, (meta-)hybrid functionals, and DHDFs, as well as to standard (direct) RPA. The new method is furthermore tested on prototype bond activations with (Ni/Pd)-based transition metal catalysts, and two difficult cases for DHDF, namely the isomerization reaction of the [Cu               2               (               en               )               2               O               2               ]               2+               complex and the singlet\textendash triplet energy difference in highly unsaturated cyclacenes. The results show that PWRB95 is almost as accurate as standard DHDF for main-group thermochemistry but has a similar or better performance for non-covalent interactions, more difficult transition metal containing molecules and other electronically problematic cases. Because of its relatively weak basis set dependence, PWRB95 can be applied even in combination with AO basis sets of only triple-zeta quality which yields huge overall computational savings by a factor of about 40 compared to standard DHDF/`quadruple-zeta' calculations. Structure optimizations of small molecules with PWRB95 indicate an accurate description of bond distances superior to that provided by TPSS-D3, PBE0-D3, or other RPA type methods.},

For the response part, a model vmodresp{$\sigma$} was used, which represents vresp as weighted orbital density contributions, the weights being determined by the orbital energies. vmodresp{$\sigma$} possesses the proper short-range behavior and the atomic-shell stepped structure characteristic for vresp. For the screening part, two model potentials vmodscr{$\sigma$} were used, one with the accurate Slater potential; the other one with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange part. Both use the GGA for the Coulomb correlation contribution to vscr{$\sigma$}. The scheme provides an adequate approximation to vxc{$\sigma$} in the outer-valence region with both the proper asymptotics and a rather accurate estimate of the ionization potential from the highest one-electron energy and a reasonable estimate of atomic Exc and total energies Etot. ? 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The first problem is the neglect of memory effects stemming from the, in TDDFT virtually unavoidable, adiabatic approximation, the second problem is the reliable evaluation of the probabilities               P               n               (               t               ) of multiple photoinduced ionization, while the third problem (which TDDFT shares with other approaches) is the reliable description of continuum states of the electrons ejected in the process of ionization. In this paper time-dependent Dyson orbital theory (TDDOT) is proposed. Exact TDDOT equations of motion (EOMs) for time-dependent Dyson orbitals are derived, which are linear differential equations with just static, feasible potentials of the electron\textendash electron interaction. No adiabatic approximation is used, which formally resolves the first TDDFT problem. TDDOT offers formally exact expressions for the complete evolution in time of the wavefunction of the outgoing electron. This leads to the correlated probability of single ionization               P               1               (               t               ) as well as the probabilities of no ionization (               P               0               (               t               )) and multiple ionization of               n               electrons,               P               n               (               t               ), which formally solves the second problem of TDDFT. For two-electron systems a proper description of the required continuum states appears to be rather straightforward, and both               P               1               (               t               ) and               P               2               (               t               ) can be calculated. Because of the exact formulation, TDDOT is expected to reproduce a notorious memory effect, the ``knee structure'' of the non-sequential double ionization of the He atom.},

These arguments are then refuted and methods for teaching chemistry without invoking the hybrid atomic orbital model are presented to show how the model can be removed from the chemistry curriculum with little negative effect.},

  abstract = {Non-covalent interactions between neutral, sterically hindered organic molecules generally involve a strong stabilizing contribution from dispersion forces that in many systems turns the `steric repulsion' into a `steric attraction'. In addition to London dispersion, such systems benefit from electrostatic stabilization, which arises from a short-range effect of charge penetration and gets bigger with increasing steric bulk. In the present work, we quantify this contribution for a diverse set of molecular cores, ranging from unsubstituted benzene and cyclohexane to their derivatives carrying               tert               -butyl, phenyl, cyclohexyl and adamantyl substituents. While the importance of electrostatic interactions in the dimers of sp               2               -rich (e.g., {$\pi$}-conjugated) cores is well appreciated, less polarizable assemblies of sp               3               -rich systems with multiple short-range CH{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}HC contacts between the bulky cyclohexyl and adamantyl moieties are also significantly influenced by electrostatics. Charge penetration is drastically larger in absolute terms for the sp               2               -rich cores, but still has a non-negligible effect on the sp               3               -rich dimers, investigated herein, both in terms of their energetics and equilibrium interaction distances. These results emphasize the importance of this electrostatic effect, which has so far been less recognized in aliphatic systems compared to London dispersion, and are therefore likely to have implications for the development of force fields and methods for crystal structure prediction.},

Modifications of the wave equation suitable for numerical work in different parts of the range of               r               are given (\textsection\textsection{} 2, 3, 5), also exact equations for the variation of a solution with a variation in the potential or of the trial value of the energy (\textsection{} 4); the use of these variation equations in preference to a complete new integration of the equation for every trial change of field or of the energy parameter avoids a great deal of numerical work.                                         For the range of               r               where the deviation from a Coulomb field is inappreciable, recurrence relations between different solutions of the wave equations which are zero at               r               = {$\infty$}, and correspond to terms with different values of the effective and subsidiary quantum numbers, are given and can be used to avoid carrying out the integration in each particular case (\textsection\textsection{} 6, 7).                          Formulae for the calculation of first order perturbations due to the relativity variation of mass and to the spinning electron are given (\textsection{} 8).             The method used for integrating the equations numerically is outlined (\textsection{} 9).},

  abstract = {The methods of solution of the wave equation for a central field given in the previous paper are applied to various atoms. For the core electrons, the details of the interaction of the electrons in a single                                n                 k                              group are neglected, but an approximate correction is made for the fact that the distributed charge of an electron does not contribute to the field acting on itself (\textsection 2).                          For a given atom the object of the work is to find a field such that the solutions of the wave equation for the core electrons in this field (corrected as just mentioned for each core electron) give a distribution of charge which reproduces the field. This is called the self-consistent field, and the process of finding it is one of successive approximation (\textsection{} 3).                            Approximations to the self-consistent field have been found for He (\textsection{} 4), Rb               +               (\textsection{} 5), Na               +               , Cl               -               (\textsection{} 9). For He the energy parameter for the solution of the wave equation for one electron in the self-consistent field of the nucleus and the other corresponds to an ionisation potential of 24{$\cdot$}85 volts (observed 24{$\cdot$}6 volts); this agreement suggests that for other atoms the values of the energy parameter in the self-consistent field (corrected for each core electron) will probably give good approximations to the X-ray terms (\textsection 4).                                         The most extensive work has been carried out for Rb               +               . The distribution of charge given by the wave functions in the self-consistent field is compared with the distribution calculated by other methods (\textsection{} 6). The values of X-ray and optical terms calculated from the self-consistent field show satisfactory agreement with those observed (\textsection{} 7).                          The wave mechanical analogue of the case in which on the orbital model an internal and an external orbit of the same energy are possible is discussed (\textsection{} 8).},

  abstract = {Our neural network predicts spin-state ordering of transition metal complexes to near-chemical accuracy with respect to DFT reference.           ,                             High-throughput computational screening has emerged as a critical component of materials discovery. Direct density functional theory (DFT) simulation of inorganic materials and molecular transition metal complexes is often used to describe subtle trends in inorganic bonding and spin-state ordering, but these calculations are computationally costly and properties are sensitive to the exchange\textendash correlation functional employed. To begin to overcome these challenges, we trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict quantum-mechanically-derived properties, including spin-state ordering, sensitivity to Hartree\textendash Fock exchange, and spin-state specific bond lengths in transition metal complexes. Our ANN is trained on a small set of inorganic-chemistry-appropriate empirical inputs that are both maximally transferable and do not require precise three-dimensional structural information for prediction. Using these descriptors, our ANN predicts spin-state splittings of single-site transition metal complexes (               i.e.               , Cr\textendash Ni) at arbitrary amounts of Hartree\textendash Fock exchange to within 3 kcal mol               -1               accuracy of DFT calculations. Our exchange-sensitivity ANN enables improved predictions on a diverse test set of experimentally-characterized transition metal complexes by extrapolation from semi-local DFT to hybrid DFT. The ANN also outperforms other machine learning models (               i.e.               , support vector regression and kernel ridge regression), demonstrating particularly improved performance in transferability, as measured by prediction errors on the diverse test set. We establish the value of new uncertainty quantification tools to estimate ANN prediction uncertainty in computational chemistry, and we provide additional heuristics for identification of when a compound of interest is likely to be poorly predicted by the ANN. The ANNs developed in this work provide a strategy for screening transition metal complexes both with direct ANN prediction and with improved structure generation for validation with first principles simulation.},

However, modeling exercises can be integrated into an undergraduate course at a nontrivial level with minor modifications to the lecture curriculum and software that is inexpensively available to individual students. The modified curriculum was tested over a two-year period, and student reception of the new curriculum was assessed by means of end-of course surveys. Students found the added computational material to be useful and not overly difficult.},

  abstract = {Accurate electronic barrier heights are obtained for a set of nine proton-transfer tautomerization reactions, which are either (i) uncatalyzed, (ii) catalyzed by one water molecule, or (iii) catalyzed by two water molecules. The barrier heights for reactions (i) and (ii) are obtained by means of the high-level ab initio W2.2 thermochemical protocol, while those for reaction (iii) are obtained using the W1 protocol. These three sets of benchmark barrier heights allow an assessment of the performance of more approximate theoretical procedures for the calculation of barrier heights of uncatalyzed and water-catalyzed reactions. We evaluate initially the performance of the composite G4 procedure and variants thereof (e.g., G4(MP2) and G4(MP2)-6X), as well as that of standard ab initio procedures (e.g., MP2, SCS-MP2, and MP4). We find that the performance of the G4(MP2)-type thermochemical procedures deteriorates with the number of water molecules involved in the catalysis. This behavior is linked to deficiencies in the MP2-based basis-set-correction term in the G4(MP2)-type procedures. This is remedied in the MP4-based G4 procedure, which shows good performance for both the uncatalyzed and the water-catalyzed reactions, with mean absolute deviations (MADs) from the benchmark values lying below the threshold of "chemical accuracy" (arbitrarily defined as 1 kcal mol(-1) {$\approx$} 4.2 kJ mol(-1)). We also examine the performance of a large number of density functional theory (DFT) and double-hybrid DFT (DHDFT) procedures. We find that, with few exceptions (most notably PW6-B95 and B97-2), the performance of the DFT procedures that give good results for the uncatalyzed reactions deteriorates with the number of water molecules involved in the catalysis. The DHDFT procedures, on the other hand, show excellent performance for both the uncatalyzed and catalyzed reactions. Specifically, almost all of them afford MADs below the "chemical accuracy" threshold, with ROB2-PLYP and B2K-PLYP showing the best overall performance.},

Subsequent reactions lead to O               2               and H               2               production.                        ,                             Water oxidation by Ti(OH)               4               in the ground and excited states was investigated using density functional ({$\Delta$}SCF, TDDFT) methods gauged by the coupled cluster (CCSD, CCSD(T)) calculations. O               2               and H               2               are generated in a reaction sequence that starts with Ti(OH)               4               reacting with H               2               O. This reaction can proceed by either nucleophilic attack by H               2               O or by H-atom abstraction from H               2               O. The nucleophilic attack has high energy barriers (40\textendash 120 kcal mol               -1               ) in both the ground and excited states. On the other hand, H abstraction is effected by Ti(OH)               4               in the excited state with a low energy barrier (4\textendash 8 kcal mol               -1               ), generating OH\textperiodcentered. This is the rate-limiting barrier in the chain of O               2               formation reactions proposed in this work. The production of free OH\textperiodcentered{} radicals is not energetically feasible in the ground state. By absorbing two photons, two hydroxyl radicals are produced, which then form H               2               O               2               . By a stepwise H-abstraction from H               2               O               2               and OOH\textperiodcentered, O               2               is generated by absorbing two more photons. In each H-abstraction reaction a Ti(OH)               4               is consumed and a Ti(OH)               3               H               2               O is produced. H               2               production can proceed thermally from the latter in a very exothermic (68\textendash 105 kcal mol               -1               ) bimolecular reaction. The solvent effects, modelled by explicit water molecules, have a limited influence on the reactivity.},

  abstract = {The density-energy balance of density functionals is quantified using trial densities. Density errors commonly amount to only a few kJ mol               -1               .                        ,                             Recently, the progression toward more exact density functional theory has been questioned, implying a need for more formal ways to systematically measure progress,               i.e.               a ``path''. Here I use the Hohenberg\textendash Kohn theorems and the definition of normality by Burke               et al.               to define a path toward exactness and ``straying'' from the ``path'' by separating errors in               {$\rho$}               and               E               [               {$\rho$}               ]. A consistent path toward exactness involves minimizing both errors. Second, a suitably diverse test set of trial densities               {$\rho$}               {${'}$} can be used to estimate the significance of errors in               {$\rho$}               without knowing the exact densities which are often inaccessible. To illustrate this, the systems previously studied by Medvedev               et al.               , the first ionization energies of atoms with               Z               = 1 to 10, the ionization energy of water, and the bond dissociation energies of five diatomic molecules were investigated using CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV5Z as benchmark at chemical accuracy. Four functionals of distinct designs was used: B3LYP, PBE, M06, and S-VWN. For atomic cations regardless of charge and compactness up to               Z               = 10, the energy effects of the different               {$\rho$}               are {$<$}4 kJ mol               -1               (chemical accuracy) defined here as ``normal'', even though these four functionals ranked very differently in the previous test. Thus, the ``off-path'' behavior for such cations is energy-wise insignificant. An interesting oscillating behavior in the density sensitivity is observed               vs. Z               , explained by orbital occupation effects. Finally, it is shown that even large ``normal'' problems such as the Co\textendash C bond energy of cobalamins can use simpler (               e.g.               PBE) trial densities to drastically speed up computation by loss of a few kJ mol               -1               in accuracy. The proposed method of using a test set of trial densities to estimate the sensitivity and significance of density errors of functionals may be useful for testing and designing new balanced functionals with more systematic improvement of densities and energies.},

  abstract = {The reaction of molecular oxygen with a polyoxometalate catalyst used for electron transfer\textendash oxygen transfer reactions shows an inner sphere process.           ,                             The reactivity of the H               5               PV               2               Mo               10               O               40               polyoxometalate and its analogues as an electron transfer and electron transfer\textendash oxygen transfer oxidant has been extensively studied in the past and has been shown to be useful in many transformations. One of the hallmarks of this oxidant is the possibility of its re-oxidation with molecular oxygen, thus enabling aerobic catalytic cycles. Although the re-oxidation reaction was known, the kinetics and mechanism of this reaction have not been studied in any detail. Experimentally, we show that both the one- and two-electron reduced polyoxometalate are reactive with O               2               , the two-electron one more so. The reactions are first-order in the polyoxometalate and O               2               . Solvents also have a considerable effect, protic solvents being preferred over aprotic ones. H               5               PV               2               Mo               10               O               40               was reduced either by an electron transfer reaction (H               2               ) or an electron transfer\textendash oxygen transfer reaction (Ph               3               P). Similar rate constants and activation parameters were observed for both. DFT calculations carried out on the re-oxidation reactions strongly suggest an inner-sphere process. The process involves first the formation of a coordinatively unsaturated site (CUS) and subsequently the binding of O               2               to form superoxo and then peroxo {$\eta$}               2               -O               2               adducts. Most interestingly, although vanadium is the reactive redox centre as well as a necessary component for the oxidative activity of H               5               PV               2               Mo               10               O               40               , and a CUS can be formed at both Mo and V sites, O               2               coordination occurs mostly at the Mo CUSs, preferably those where the vanadium centers are distal to each other.},

Changing to 10\% CO2/90\% 02 on both surfaces doubles the acid secretory rate. We calculate that, were the rate of oxygen consumption to increase significantly as a result of secretory stimulation, the tissue would now be oxygen limited. This prediction is tested by raising the P02 by increasing the total pressure in a hyperbaric chamber. Since no change in acid secretory rate or potential difference was observed upon changing from PO2 = 0.9 to PO2 = 1.9 atm, we conclude that the tissue is not O2 limited at normal pressure. Decreasing PO2 below 0.9 atm, by contrast, decreases the acid secretory rate and raises both PD and resistance. We infer that the rate of oxygen consumption did not rise significantly when acid secretion was increased by supplying sufficient CO2.},

Here we present a new modular approach to the design of caging groups based on photoinduced electron transfer from an electron-rich two-photon dye to an electron acceptor, followed by scission of an ester to release a carboxylic acid. Three different electron acceptors were tested: nitrobenzyl, phenacyl and pyridinium. The nitrobenzyl system was ineffective, giving only photochemical decomposition and no release of the carboxylic acid. The phenacyl system also performed poorly, liberating the carboxylic acid in 20\% chemical yield and 0.2\% photochemical yield. The pyridinium system was most successful, and was tested for the release of two carboxylic acids: {$\gamma$}-amino butyric acid (GABA) and tryptophan. The caged GABA undergoes photochemical cleavage with a chemical yield of {$>$}95\% and a photochemical yield of 1\%; it exhibits a two-photon absorption cross section of 1100 GM at 700 nm, corresponding to a two-photon uncaging cross section of 10 {$\pm$} 3 GM.},

None of the functionals considered accounts successfully for the dispersion interaction. The Becke exchange and the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP) exchange-correlation functionals yield a purely repulsive potential after counterpoise correction. The Dirac-Slater (D-S) functional gives minima which are too deep, at internuclear distances which are too short, particularly for He* and Ne,. The experimental repulsive potential is reproduced best by D-S calculations while the B-LYP results are close to the SCF ones.},

Placed in a modern context, the hybrid orbital concept helps to familiarize students with the methods of working chemists, foster construction of a deeper, more interconnected understanding of chemistry and its connection to the laws of nature, and provides a secure foundation for more advanced chemistry classes.},

  abstract = {The existence of a generalized Hartree\textendash Fock solution in C               60               has led to controversy on whether C               60               is polyradicaloid (or strongly correlated). We attempt to end the controversy with               {$\kappa$}               -OOMP2 which removes the illusion of this artificial symmetry breaking. We conclude that C               60               is not strongly correlated.                        ,                             We present a thorough analysis of symmetry breaking observed in Hartree\textendash Fock (HF) solutions of the C               60               , C               36               , and C               20               fullerenes in order to characterize the nature of electron correlation in them. Our analysis is based on (1) the critical regularization strength to restore symmetry breaking in the recently developed regularized orbital optimized second-order M\o ller\textendash Plesset perturbation theory (               {$\kappa$}               -OOMP2), (2) singlet\textendash triplet gaps from various MP2 methods, and (3) natural orbital occupation numbers from restricted coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (RCCSD) and coupled-cluster valence bond with singles and doubles (CCVB-SD). Based on these three independent probes, we conclude that C               36               (               D               6h               ) exhibits genuine strong correlation and symmetry breaking whereas C               60               exhibits artificial HF symmetry breaking and is not strongly correlated. Investigating the critical regularization strength, we discuss strong correlation in C               20               at the Jahn\textendash Teller distorted geometries (               C               2h               ,               D               2h               ,               C               i               , and               D               3h               ) and the               I               h               geometry. Only C               20               (               I               h               ) was found to be strongly correlated while others exhibit artificial HF symmetry breaking. This analysis highlights a useful feature of the recommended               {$\kappa$}               -OOMP2 method. It is an electronic structure method that describes dynamic correlation, and attenuates strong correlation in MP2 towards zero by regularization. Therefore,               {$\kappa$}               -OOMP2 will exhibit symmetry breaking in its reference determinant only when correlation is strong (               i.e.               , essential symmetry breaking). Artificial symmetry breaking (arising in HF due to neglect of dynamic correlation) thus appears to be removed in               {$\kappa$}               -OOMP2.},

  abstract = {An energy decomposition analysis (EDA) for single chemical bonds is presented within the framework of Kohn\textendash Sham density functional theory based on spin projection equations that are exact within wave function theory. Chemical bond energies can then be understood in terms of stabilization caused by spin-coupling augmented by dispersion, polarization, and charge transfer in competition with destabilizing Pauli repulsions. The EDA reveals distinguishing features of chemical bonds ranging across nonpolar, polar, ionic, and charge-shift bonds. The effect of electron correlation is assessed by comparison with Hartree\textendash Fock results. Substituent effects are illustrated by comparing the C\textendash C bond in ethane against that in bis(diamantane), and dispersion stabilization in the latter is quantified. Finally, three metal\textendash metal bonds in experimentally characterized compounds are examined: a                                                                        Mg                     I                                                                  \textendash{}                                                                        Mg                     I                                                                  dimer, the                                                                        Zn                     I                                                                  \textendash{}                                                                        Zn                     I                                                                  bond in dizincocene, and the Mn\textendash Mn bond in dimanganese decacarbonyl.},

Prior knowledge embedded in the physics computation itself rarely draws attention.

Two separations suffice for learning the entire one-dimensional H\$\_2\$ dissociation curve within chemical accuracy, including the strongly correlated region. Our models also generalize to unseen types of molecules and overcome self-interaction error.},

  abstract = {The self-interaction error (SIE), i.e. unphysical interactions of electrons with themselves, has plagued developers and users of Density Functional Approximations (DFAs) since the inception of Density Functional Theory (DFT). Formally,...           ,                             The self-interaction error (SIE), i.e. unphysical interactions of electrons with themselves, has plagued developers and users of Density Functional Approximations (DFAs) since the inception of Density Functional Theory (DFT). Formally, it can be separated into the one-electron and many-electron SIE; herein we present one of the most comprehensive studies of the first. While we focus mostly on the total SIE, we also make use of two different decompositions. The first is a separation into functional and density-driven errors as championed by Sim, Burke and co-workers [               J. Phys. Chem. Lett.               , 2018,               9               , 6385-6392]; the second separates the error into exchange, correlation, and one-electron components, with the latter being a density error that has not been discussed in this form before. After investigating the familiar hydrogen atom and dihydrogen cation, we establish a relationship between the SIE and the nuclear charge with the help of a series of heavier hydrogenic analogues. For the mononuclear systems and the diatomics at the dissociation limit, this relationship is linear in nature with prominent exceptions, mostly belonging to the Minnesota and range-separated (double-)hybrid DFAs. For the first time, we also show how the magnitude of the SIE depends on the underlying atomic-orbital basis set and how DFAs that rely on a popular van-der-Waals-DFT type London-dispersion term exhibit ``self-dispersion''. We find that range separation is not a panacea for solving the one-electron SIE. DFAs that have been developed to be one-electron SIE free for one system, such as the hydrogen atom, show larger errors for heavier hydrogenic systems. Often, one-electron SIE-free DFAs rely on fortuitous error cancellation between their exchange and correlation components. An analysis of the most robust methods for general applications to date reveals that they suffer moderately from the one-electron SIE, while DFAs that are nearly SIE-free do not perform well in applications. Implicit in the continued existence of the one-electron SIE is that well-performing DFAs continue to suffer insufficiencies at their fundamental levels that are being compensated for by the SIE. Our analysis includes more than 250,000 datapoints, resulting in multiple insights that may drive future developments of new DFAs or SIE corrections.},

Self-immolative chemistry offers a generic method for the development of catalysts that can be activated by different signals. To demonstrate the versatility of that concept, we synthesized organocatalysts that can be activated by three different signals and that can be used to control two different reactions. In this way the organocatalyst proline is designed as a pro-catalyst that is activated either by the chemical signal H               2               O               2               , by light or by the enzyme penicillin acylase.

This approach keeps the electronic structure calculations conceptually simple and computationally cheap, making this method accessible for a teaching lab with only minimal computational resources. This method is especially applicable to the bomb calorimeter experiment that typically appears in the physical chemistry teaching laboratory, and we provide an example of how our electronic structure calculations can be integrated into the laboratory curriculum.},

  abstract = {The largest double-hybrid DFT study cleans up the `zoo' of non-empirical double hybrids and reveals their lack of general applicability.           ,                             The development of non-empirical double-hybrid density functionals (DHDFs) is a very active research area with the number of approaches in this field having increased rapidly. At the same time, there is a lack of published work that provides a fair assessment and comparison between non-empirical and semi-empirical DHDFs on an equal footing. Herein, we close this gap and present a thorough analysis of both classes of DHDFs on the large GMTKN55 benchmark database for general main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions [Goerigk               et al.               ,               Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.               , 2017,               19               , 32184\textendash 32215]. In total, 115 variations of dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected DHDFs are tested, which will be condensed to an in-depth assessment of 31 methods: 19 non-empirical and 12 semi-empirical DHDFs. As such, our study represents the largest DHDF study ever conducted and can serve as an important benchmark informing method developers and users alike. Our results show that semi-empirical DHDFs are the most robust density functional approximations and more reliable and accurate than non-empirical ones. In fact, some non-empirical approaches are even outperformed by hybrid approaches or even dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected MP2 and SCS-MP2. SOS0-PBE0-2-D3(BJ) is the only exception and the only non-empirical DHDF that we can safely recommend for general applicability. However, it is still outperformed by six semi-empirical DHDFs, of which we would like to particularly recommend the following five: {$\omega$}B97X-2-D3(BJ), DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ), DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ), B2NC-PLYP-D3(BJ), and B2GPPLYP-D3(BJ). Our findings seriously question current trends in the field and they highlight that novel strategies have to be found in order to outperform the currently best density functional theory methods on the market. We hope that our study can function as an important cornerstone inspiring such a change of direction in the field.},

  abstract = {Electronic couplings and vertical excitation energies are crucial determinants of charge and excitation energy transfer rates in a broad variety of processes ranging from biological charge transfer to charge transport through inorganic materials, from molecular sensing to intracellular signaling. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is generally used to calculate these critical parameters, but the quality of the results is unpredictable because of the semiempirical nature of the available DFT approaches. This study identifies a small set of fundamental rules that enables accurate DFT computation of electronic couplings and vertical excitation energies in molecular complexes and materials. These rules are applied to predict efficient DFT approaches to coupling calculations. The result is an easy-to-use guide for reliable DFT descriptions of electronic transitions.},

Theory Comput.} \textbf{2018}, \emph{14}, 5725]. In this study, we present DFT-D4 damping parameters to build the DFT-D4 counterparts of these functionals and assess these in comparison. We extend our analysis beyond GMTKN55 and especially turn our attention to enzymatically catalysed and metal-organic reactions. We find that B97M-D4 is now the second-best performing meta-GGA functional for the GMTKN55 database and it can provide noticeably better organometallic reaction energies com- pared to B97M-D3(BJ). Moreover, the aforementioned DFT-D3(BJ) based functionals have not been thoroughly assessed for geometries and herein we close this gap by analysing geometries of noncovalently bound dimers and trimers, peptide conformers, water hexamers and transition-metal complexes. We find that several of the B97(M)- based methods\textemdash particularly the DFT-D4 versions\textemdash surpass the accuracy of previously studied methods for peptide conformer, water hexamer, and transition-metal complex geometries, making them safe-to-use, cost-efficient alternatives to the original methods. The DFT-D4 variants can be easily used with ORCA4.1 and above. {$<$}/p{$>$} 		 	 	 		 				{$<$}/div{$>$} 			{$<$}/div{$>$} 		{$<$}/div{$>$}},

Increasing the amount of exchange in a functional typically shifts the preferred ground state in first-row TMCs from low-spin to high-spin by penalizing delocalization error, but the effect on properties of second-row complexes is less well known. We compare the exchange sensitivity of adiabatic spin-splitting energies in pairs of mononuclear 3d and 4d mid-row octahedral transition-metal complexes. We analyze hundreds of complexes assembled from four metals in two oxidation states with ten small monodentate ligands that span a wide range of field strengths expected to favor a variety of ground states. We observe consistently lower but proportional sensitivity to exchange fraction among 4d TMCs with respect to their isovalent 3d TMC counterparts, leading to the largest difference in sensitivities for the strongest field ligands. The combined effect of reduced exchange sensitivities and the greater low-spin bias of most 4d TMCs means that while over one-third of 3d TMCs change ground states over a modest variation (               ca.               0.0\textendash 0.3) in exchange fraction, almost no 4d TMCs do. Differences in delocalization, as judged through changes in the metal\textendash ligand bond lengths between spin states, do not explain the distinct behavior of 4d TMCs. Instead, evaluation of potential energy curves in 3d and 4d TMCs reveals that higher exchange sensitivities in 3d TMCs are likely due to the opposing effect of exchange on the low-spin and high-spin states, whereas the effect on both spin states is more comparable in 4d TMCs.},

  abstract = {MC-PDFT can give the most accurate excitation energies for both valence and Rydberg states of 1,4-cyclohexadiene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene when the active space includes Rydberg orbitals.           ,              The molecules 1,4-cyclohexadiene (unconjugated 1,4-CHD) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated 1,3-CHD) both have two double bonds, but these bonds interact in different ways. These molecules have long served as examples of through-bond and through-space interactions, respectively, and their electronic structures have been studied in detail both experimentally and theoretically, with the experimental assignments being especially complete. The existence of Rydberg states interspersed with the valence states makes the quantum mechanical calculation of their spectra a challenging task. In this work, we explore the electronic excitation energies of 1,4-CHD and 1,3-CHD for both valence and Rydberg states by means of complete active space second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2), extended multi-state CASPT2 (XMS-CASPT2), and multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT); it is shown by comparison to experiment that MC-PDFT yields the most accurate results. We found that the inclusion of Rydberg orbitals in the active space not only enables the calculation of Rydberg excitation energies but also improves the accuracy of the valence ones. A special characteristic of the present analysis is the calculation of the second moments of the excited-state orbitals. Because we find that the CASPT2 densities agree well with the CASSCF ones and since the MC-PDFT methods gets accurate excitation energies based on the CASSCF densities, we believe that we can trust these moments as far as giving a more accurate picture of the diffuseness of the excited-state orbitals in these prototype molecules than has previously been available.},

The paper demonstrates that approximations are in fact in the core of some recent discussions in the philosophy of chemistry: on the shape of molecules, the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the role of orbitals, and the physical explanation of the Periodic Table of Elements. The ontological and epistemological significance of approximations in the exact sciences is analyzed. The crucial role of approximations in generating qualitative images and comprehensible models is emphasized. A complementarity relation between numerically `exact' theories and explanatory approximate approaches is claimed.},

However, the currently available caged materials are just at the limit of their usability and have several drawbacks. The local and focal nature of their use may for example be jeopardized by a high spontaneous hydrolysis rate of the commercially available compounds with increased photochemical release rate. Here, using quantum chemical modelling we show the mechanisms of hydrolysis and two-photon activation, and synthesized more effective caged compounds. Furthermore, we have developed a new enzymatic elimination method removing neurotransmitters inadvertently escaping from their compound during experiment. This method, usable both in one and two-photon experiments, allows for the use of materials with an increased rate of photochemical release. The efficiency of the new compound and the enzymatic method and of the new compound are demonstrated in neurophysiological experiments.},

Students use TGA to generate and isolate the reaction intermediates and final product. Three common TGA transitions (the loss of water, the generation of a metal carbonate, and the generation of a metal oxide) with very different reaction temperatures are observed with this sample. The resulting four samples (starting material, two intermediates, and final product) are then analyzed by FTIR. Students are able to observe the progress of the reaction through a comparison of the IR spectra, via the change of water, O-H, and C-H signals. The computational analysis of the vibrational frequencies of carbonate is performed to demonstrate the concepts of predicting the number of principal vibrational frequencies, vibrational degeneracy, and IR activity in addition to aiding in the identification of the second decomposition intermediate, CaCO3. This integrated approach also encourages students to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of various techniques and recognize that often chemical analysis requires the use of multiple tools.},

Perdew and Wang have developed a GGA based on real-space cutoff of the spurious long-range components of the second-order gradient expansion for the exchange-correlation hole. We have found that this density functional performs well in numerical tests for a variety of systems: (1) Total energies of 30 atoms are highly accurate. (2) Ionization energies and electron affinities are improved in a statistical sense, although significant interconfigurational and interterm errors remain. (3) Accurate atomization energies are found for seven hydrocarbon molecules, with a rms error per bond of 0.1 eV, compared with 0.7 eV for the LSD approximation and 2.4 eV for the Hartree-Fock approximation. (4) For atoms and molecules, there is a cancellation of error between density functionals for exchange and correlation, which is most striking whenever the Hartree-Fock result is furthest from experiment. (5) The surprising LSD underestimation of the lattice constants of Li and Na by 3\textendash 4 \% is corrected, and the magnetic ground state of solid Fe is restored. (6) The work function, surface energy (neglecting the long-range contribution), and curvature energy of a metallic surface are all slightly reduced in comparison with LSD. Taking account of the positive long-range contribution, we find surface and curvature energies in good agreement with experimental or exact values. Finally, a way is found to visualize and understand the nonlocality of exchange and correlation, its origins, and its physical effects.},

Within the random-phase approximation (RPA), this representation allows for the r(s)-3/4 behavior as r(s)\textendash{$>$}infinity. Close agreement with numerical RPA values for epsilon(c)(r(s),0), epsilon(c)(r(s), 1), and the spin stiffness alpha(c)(r(s))=partial derivative 2-epsilon(c) (r(s), zeta=0)/delta-zeta-2, and recovery of the correct r(s)lnr(s) term for r(s)\textendash{$>$}0, indicate the appropriateness of the chosen analytic form. Beyond RPA, different parameters for the same analytic form are found by fitting to the Green's-function Monte Carlo data of Ceperley and Alder [Phys. Rev.

Phys. 58, 1200 (1980)] or by Perdew and Zunger (PZ) [Phys. Rev. B 23, 5048 (1981)]. While we confirm the practical accuracy of the VWN and PZ representations, we eliminate some minor problems with these forms. We study the zeta-dependent coefficients in the high- and low-density expansions, and the r(s)-dependent spin susceptibility. We also present a conjecture for the exact low-density limit. The correlation potential mu(c)sigma(r(s),zeta) is evaluated for use in self-consistent density-functional calculations.},

Solvent effects are included using our ab initio continuum solvation strategy, COSab, a conductor-like continuum solvation model, modified for ab initio in the quantum chemistry program GAMESS. Structure and properties are investigated across various functionals to evaluate their ability to properly model dispersion and solvation effects. The commonly used S22 set with accurate interaction energies of organic complexes has been used for parametrization studies of dispersion parameters and relevant solvation parameters. Dunning's correlation consistent basis sets, cc-pVnZ (n = D, T), are used in the optimization, together with the Grimme B97-D exchange-correlation functional. Both water (epsilon = 78.4) and ether (epsilon = 4.33) environments are considered. Optimized semiempirical dispersion correction parameters and solvent extent radii are proposed for several functionals. We find that special parametrization of the semiempirical dispersion correction when used together in the DFT-D/COSab approach is not necessary, The global performance is quite acceptable in terms of chemical accuracy and suggests that this approach is a reliable as well as economical method for evaluation of solvent effects in systems with dispersive interactions. The resulting theory is applied to a group of push-pull pyrrole systems to illustrate the effects of donor/acceptor and solvation on their conformational and energetic properties.},

Additionally, challenges associated with carrying out complete basis set extrapolation procedures and treatment of basis set superposition error (BSSE) are of importance in these descriptions. In this work, investigation into the ability to accurately predict the potential energy surfaces of the main Rg(3) molecules (Rg = He, Ne, Ar) is made across a range of wave function types and large basis sets, including the use of several established extrapolation procedures and counterpoise corrections. Wave function types span most classes of density functional types, including the newest DFT-D schemes, and are benchmarked against high accuracy CCSD(T)/CBS methodology. Study of such systems is valuable, as they serve as simple models for many complex properties, most importantly n-body weak interaction energies.},

  abstract = {The self-interaction error (SIE) of commonly used density functional theory (DFT) exchange functionals mimics long-range (nondynamic) pair correlation effects in an unspecified way. Slater exchange suffers from a larger SIE and, therefore, covers more nondynamic correlation effects than Becke exchange, which is the reason why exchange\textendash correlation (XC) functionals based on Slater exchange lead to stabler restricted DFT solutions than those based on Becke exchange. However, the stability of an XC functional does not guarantee higher accuracy. On the contrary, if system-specific nondynamic correlation effects have to be introduced via the form of the wave function, these will be suppressed by nondynamic correlation effects already covered by the exchange functional. Hybrid functionals suffer less from the SIE and, therefore, cover a smaller number of nondynamic electron correlation effects. Accordingly, they are better suited when nondynamic electron correlation has to be introduced by the form of the wave function. It is shown that, for example, broken-symmetry unrestricted DFT calculations are more accurate when carried out with B3LYP than BLYP contrary to claims made in the literature.},

The focus of this work is set on the generation of proper thermodynamic ensembles at a quantum chemical level for conformers, but similar procedures for protonation states, tautomerism and non-covalent complex geometries are also discussed. The conformational ensembles consisting of all significantly populated minimum energy structures normally form the basis of further, mostly DFT computational work, such as the calculation of spectra or macroscopic properties. By using basic quantum chemical methods, electronic effects or possible bond breaking/formation are accounted for and a very reasonable initial energetic ranking of the candidate structures is obtained. Due to the huge computational speedup gained by the fast low-cost quantum chemical methods, overall short computation times even for systems with hundreds of atoms (typically drug-sized molecules) are achieved. Furthermore, specialized applications, such as sampling with implicit solvation models or constrained conformational sampling for transition-states, metal-, surface-, or noncovalently bound complexes are discussed, opening many possible applications in modern computational chemistry and drug discovery. The procedures have been implemented in a freely available computer code called CREST, that makes use of the fast and reliable GFN               n               -xTB methods.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we assess the performance of 24 density functional theory (DFT) based methods classified into 5 categories (GGA, MGGA, HGGA, HMGGA and DHGGA) in predicting reaction energetics, transition state geometries, and the degree of synchronicity/nonsynchronicity in the formation of two new C-C single-bonds in three Diels-Alder reactions between symmetrically and unsymmetrically substituted cyanoethylenes and cyclopentadiene, which gradually proceed from fully synchronous to highly asynchronous concerted mechanisms. This important concept in reaction mechanism is unveiled by the fine structure of the reaction force constant {$\kappa$}({$\xi$}) along the transition region. Some wave function theory (WFT) based methods are also assessed against the CCSD(T) and CCSD benchmarks for energy and geometry, respectively. The results and the statistical analysis of the errors confirm the robustness of SCSMP2 (a WFT-based method) as one of the most reliable computational approaches. Regarding DFT-based methods, hybrid exchange-correlation functionals combined with medium-range electron correlation effects or long-range corrected exchange appear as the best performing methods, highlighting both M11 and M06-2X, since a certain percentage of exact Hartree-Fock exchange could be counterbalancing the delocalization errors that suffer pure functionals. Thus, they reliably describe energetics, geometries and the degree of synchronicity in the formation of the new C-C single bonds in Diels-Alder reactions. Noticeably, a discrete performance for double hybrid functionals and poor performance for the most popular B3LYP method was found as well.},

  abstract = {Surface modification has been considered as a fundamental item in upper-division undergraduate and master courses. Thus, the development of experiments regarding processes and characterization of surfacemodification phenomena is highly desired. In this article, we propose an electrochemical and computational study of widely used surfacefunctionalization reactions. Electrochemistry was used as a tool to favor the reactions on a pencil tip, which acted as the electrode. By means of cyclic voltammetry, the reduction of two different precursors of grafting species was characterized. The differences observed in the electrochemical signal for both precursors were rationalized through thermodynamics parameters for the reduction reaction calculated by density functional theory (DFT). A theoretical value can be found with an acceptable error (around 12\%) when compared with the electrochemical experimental difference. Consequently, a simple, economic, and complete practical and theoretical exercise is presented as an introduction to the Electrochemistry, Surface Chemistry, and Theoretical Chemistry fields.},

  abstract = {These two volumes deal with the quantum theory of the electronic structure of ab initio is the notion that approximate solutions molecules. Implicit in the term of Schrodinger's equation are sought "from the beginning," i. e., without recourse to experimental data. From a more pragmatic viewpoint, the distinƯ guishing feature of ab initio theory is usually the fact that no approximations are involved in the evaluation of the required molecular integrals. Consistent with current activity in the field, the first of these two volumes contains chapters dealing with methods per se, while the second concerns the application of these methods to problems of chemical interest. In a sense, the motivation for these volumes has been the spectacular recent success of ab initio theory in resolving important chemical questions. However, these applications have only become possible through the less visible but equally important efforts of those developing new theoretical and computational methods and models. Henry F.

Subsequent calculation and examination of the relative energies of the products and of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the products' common cationic intermediate provide a means of understanding the unique regioselectivity of the reaction. The combination of spectroscopic, spectrometric, and molecular modeling data obtained by students allows them not only to identify the products and propose a reasonable stepwise mechanism for the reaction, but also to rationalize why the non-Zaitsev product predominates.},

Poor aqueous solubility leads to low bio-availability, reducing pharmaceutical effectiveness. The human cost of inefficient drug candidate testing is of great medical concern, with fewer drugs making it to the production line, slowing the development of new treatments. In biochemistry and biophysics, water mediated reactions and interactions within active sites and protein pockets are an active area of research, in which methods for modelling solvated systems are continually pushed to their limits. Here, we discuss a multitude of methods aimed towards solvent modelling and solubility prediction, aiming to inform the reader of the options available, and outlining the various advantages and disadvantages of each approach.},

Most of the methods are quite efficient thanks to density fitting and multi-core parallelism. The program is a hybrid of C++ and Python, and calculations may be run with very simple text files or using the Python API, facilitating post-processing and complex workflows; method developers also have access to most of Psi4's core functionality via Python. Job specification may be passed using The Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) QCSchema data format, facilitating interoperability. A rewrite of our top-level computation driver, and concomitant adoption of the MolSSI QCArchive Infrastructure project, make the latest version of Psi4 well suited to distributed computation of large numbers of independent tasks. The project has fostered the development of independent software components that may be reused in other quantum chemistry programs. {$<$}/p{$>$} 				{$<$}/div{$>$} 			{$<$}/div{$>$} 		{$<$}/div{$>$}},

  abstract = {Relativistic compact effective potentials (RCEP), which replace the atomic core electrons in molecular calculations, have been derived from numerical Dirac\textendash Fock atomic wavefunctions using shape-consistent valence pseudo-orbitals and an optimizing procedure based on an energy-overlap functional. Potentials are presented for the third-, fourth-, and fifth-row atoms of the Periodic Table (excluding the lanthanide series). The efficiency of molecular calculations is enhanced by using compact Gaussian expansions (no more than three terms) to represent the radial components of the potentials, and energy-optimized, shared-exponent, contracted-Gaussian atomic orbital basis sets. Transferability of the potentials has been tested by comparing calculated atomic excitation energies and ionization potentials with values obtained from numerical relativistic Hartree\textendash Fock calculations. For the alkali and alkaline earth atoms, core polarization potentials (CPP) have been derived which may be added to the RCEP to make possible accurate molecular calculations without explicitly including core-valence correlating configurations in the wavefunction. Keywords: model potentials, effective core potentials, transition metals, relativistic calculations.},

When evaluating the functional performances, the current literature has focused much more on the ability of the method to reproduce exact electronic energies than on exact geometries. As all calculations have to start from the right geometries, the present feature article explores the functional performances on geometry predictions involving covalently and non-covalently bonded systems, as well as transition state structures with emphasis on the XYG3 type of doubly hybrid (xDH) functionals. The results are also presented for some challenging cases, demonstrating the usefulness of the xDH functionals in general.},

The isomers are optimized at the PBE-D3/def2-TZVP level of theory and their relative energies are obtained at the affordable and accurate hybrid-DFT level PW6B95-D3               ATM               /def2-QZVP. For the first time reliable values for the relative energy distribution among the 1812 isomers (maximum value of 549.1 kcal mol               -1               , average value of 189.8 {$\pm$} 46.8 kcal mol               -1               , 1267 isomers in an energy window of 150\textendash 250 kcal mol               -1               ) are given. The quality of the DFT energies is verified by comparison with highly accurate DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS* results for ten selected C               60               isomers, and the DFT results are further used to benchmark several semiempirical methods. Our findings yield methodological insight into future multi-level modelling of larger carbon nano-structures. We correlate the best relative energies of the isomers to a number of topological indices, electronic properties, and geometrical measures in order to rationalize the isomeric stability aside from the common isolated pentagon rule minimizing the number of pentagon fusions. The information from the best qualitative measures can be condensed to the statement, that a small pentagon signature               P               1               , a large volume, and a more spherical cage lead to a relatively stable isomer. In addition, the best semiempirical method was applied to all 31\,924 isomers of C               80               .},

The innovative exercise, which integrates elements of synthesis, mechanisms, instrumental analysis, computational chemistry, and collaboration, provides students with an opportunity to learn important laboratory skills while highlighting key concepts covered in class. In particular, the coupling constants from 1H NMR spectroscopy are used to diagnose the stereochemistry of addition, and integral ratios are evaluated to determine percent conversion of the starting alkenes into dichlorocyclopropanes. The experimental observations are correlated with results from calculations of the singlet-triplet energy gap in the carbene.},

This essay discusses a framework for interpretation. Although this interpretation is not new, we believe it is important to present this framework in light of recent publications. The key point is that these experiments provide information about how the electron distribution changes upon ionization, not how electrons behave in the pre-ionized state. Therefore, these experiments do not lead to a ``selection of the correct orbitals'' in chemistry and do not overturn the well-known conclusion that both delocalized molecular orbitals and localized molecular orbitals are useful for interpreting chemical structure and dynamics. The two types of orbitals can produce identical total molecular electron densities and therefore molecular properties. Different types of orbitals are useful for different purposes.},

The laboratory practice can combine various experiments: (i) synthesis of solid transition metal complexes, (ii) analysis of the solid complexes to hypothesize their coordination geometry, (iii) measurement of room temperature and frozen solution EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) spectra obtained when dissolving the solid complexes in different solvents, (iv) software simulation of room temperature and frozen solution EPR spectra, (v) measurement of UV-vis spectra of solutions obtained when dissolving the solid complexes in different solvents, (vi) optimization of the coordination geometry of V(IV)O2+ complexes with DFT calculations, (vii) calculation of the EPR parameters of V(IV)O2+ complexes with DFT methods, and (viii) influence of the temperature on the equilibrium calculated using DFT methods.

The resulting formula does not resort to the use of exact-exchange mixing. A Kohn-Sham implementation of this functional is constructed and the parameters within the functional are adjusted to minimize the difference between the theoretical and the experimental data for a large set of atomic and molecular systems. The results are found to compare favorably with existing functionals, even those which include exact-exchange mixing. (C) 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {This work investigates the performances of a variety of density functionals for their ability to accurately predict charge distributions of a range of single- and multi-reference molecules.           ,              Dipole moments are the first moment of electron density and are fundamental quantities that are often available from experiments. An exchange\textendash correlation functional that leads to an accurate representation of the charge distribution of a molecule should accurately predict the dipole moments of the molecule. It is well known that Kohn\textendash Sham density functional theory (DFT) is more accurate for the energetics of single-reference systems than for the energetics of multi-reference ones, but there has been less study of charge distributions. In this work, we benchmark 48 density functionals chosen with various combinations of ingredients, against accurate experimental data for dipole moments of 78 molecules, in particular 55 single-reference molecules and 23 multi-reference ones. We chose both organic and inorganic molecules, and within the category of inorganic molecules there are both main-group and transition-metal-containing molecules, with some of them being multi-reference. As one would expect, the multi-reference molecules are not as well described by single-reference DFT, and the functionals tested in this work do show larger mean unsigned errors (MUEs) for the 23 multi-reference molecules than the single-reference ones. Five of the 78 molecules have relatively large experimental error bars and were therefore not included in calculating the overall MUEs. For the 73 molecules not excluded, we find that three of the hybrid functionals, B97-1, PBE0, and TPSSh (each with less than or equal to 25\% Hartree\textendash Fock (HF) exchange), the range-separated hybrid functional, HSE06 (with HF exchange decreasing from 25\% to 0 as interelectronic distance increases), and the hybrid functional, PW6B95 (with 28\% HF exchange) are the best performing functionals with each yielding an MUE of 0.18 D. Perhaps the most significant finding of this study is that there exists great similarity among the success rate of various functionals in predicting dipole moments. In particular, of 39 functionals designed as general-purpose functionals and that do not have a global value of 100\% HF exchange, the average MUE is 0.23 D, with a standard deviation of only 0.04 D. Among gradient approximations, which are especially interesting because of their speed and portability, the best overall performance is by PBE, HCTH/407, OLYP, OreLYP, and GAM, each with MUE of 0.22 D.},

The main focus of this method is to enhance student understanding of the symmetry properties of vibrational modes and of the group theory analysis of infrared (IR) spectra by using visual aids provided by computer molecular modeling. It can be implemented in an upper-level inorganic chemistry course. Using molecular modeling techniques, students are able to calculate the IR spectra of organometallic compounds and watch the animated movies of vibrational modes in action. Visual images of vibrational modes help students to identify the characteristic peaks in an IR spectrum and enable them to see the symmetry properties of vibrational modes and understand the physical meaning of the irreducible representations of the vibrational modes. In addition, the visual images of vibrational modes help students to understand why some of the vibrational modes are IR active whereas others are not. Results of sample calculations using both semiempirical and density functional theory methods are discussed. Student evaluations on the teaching method are also presented.},

  abstract = {Screened-exchange hybrid density functionals are especially recommended for solid-state systems because they combine the advantages of hybrid functionals with the correct physics and lower computational cost associated with the attenuation of Hartree\textendash Fock exchange at long range. We present a screened-exchange hybrid functional, M06-SX, that combines the functional form of the local revM06-L functional with a percentage of short-range nonlocal Hartree\textendash Fock exchange. The M06-SX functional gives good results not only for a large set of training data but also for several databases quite different from the training data. The mean unsigned error (MUE) of the M06-SX functional is 2.85 kcal/mol for 418 atomic and molecular energies (AME418) in Minnesota Database 2019, which is better than all five other screened-exchange hybrid functionals tested in this work. The M06-SX functional also gives especially good results for semiconductor band gaps, molecular dissociation energies, noncovalent interactions, barrier heights, and electronic excitation energies excluding long-range charge transfer excitations. For the LC18 lattice constants database, the M06-SX functional gives an MUE of only 0.034 \AA. Therefore, the M06-SX functional is well suited for studying molecular chemistry as well as solid-state physics.},

  abstract = {We have assessed integration grid errors arising from the use of popular DFT quadrature schemes for a set of 34 organic reaction energies. The focus is primarily on M05-2X and the M06 suite of functionals (M06-L, M06, M06-2X, and M06-HF). M05-2X, M06, and M06-2X outperform popular older DFT functionals for the reaction energies studied and offer accuracies comparable to results from perturbative hybrid DFT functionals. However, these new functionals are more sensitive to the choice of quadrature grid than previous generations of DFT functionals. Errors in predicted reaction energies arising from the use of the popular SG-1 integration grid, which is the default in the Q-Chem package, are significant. In particular, M06-HF reaction energies computed with the SG-1 grid exhibit errors ranging from -6.7 to 3.2 kcal mol(-1), relative to results computed with a very fine integration grid. This grid sensitivity is not a general problem for meta-generalized gradient approximation functionals, but is instead due to the specific functional forms used in these functionals. The large grid errors are traced to the kinetic energy density enhancement factor utilized in the exchange component of the M05-2X and the M06 functionals. This term contains empirically adjusted parameters that are of large magnitude for all of these functionals and for M06-HF in particular. The product of these large constants and modest integration errors for the kinetic energy density results in very large errors in individual contributions to the exchange energy. This gives rise to the large errors in reaction energies exhibited by these functionals for certain integration grids.},

  abstract = {A large scale benchmark for molecular machine learning consisting of multiple public datasets, metrics, featurizations and learning algorithms.           ,              Molecular machine learning has been maturing rapidly over the last few years. Improved methods and the presence of larger datasets have enabled machine learning algorithms to make increasingly accurate predictions about molecular properties. However, algorithmic progress has been limited due to the lack of a standard benchmark to compare the efficacy of proposed methods; most new algorithms are benchmarked on different datasets making it challenging to gauge the quality of proposed methods. This work introduces MoleculeNet, a large scale benchmark for molecular machine learning. MoleculeNet curates multiple public datasets, establishes metrics for evaluation, and offers high quality open-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular featurization and learning algorithms (released as part of the DeepChem open source library). MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that learnable representations are powerful tools for molecular machine learning and broadly offer the best performance. However, this result comes with caveats. Learnable representations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity and highly imbalanced classification. For quantum mechanical and biophysical datasets, the use of physics-aware featurizations can be more important than choice of particular learning algorithm.},

The environment-perturbed transition-state sampling method has been developed to calculate free energies, kinetic isotope effects, and quasi-classical reaction trajectories of enzyme-catalyzed reactions and the uncatalyzed reaction in water. Energetics calculated in this way reproduce the experiment and show that the normal Diels\textendash Alder transition state is stabilized by H bonds with water molecules, while the ambimodal transition state is favored in the enzyme SpnF by both intramolecular hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic binding. Molecular dynamics simulations show that trajectories passing through the ambimodal transition state bifurcate to the [6+4] adduct and the Diels\textendash Alder adduct with a ratio of 1:1 in the gas phase, 1:1.6 in water, and 1:11 in the enzyme. This example shows how an enzyme acts on a vibrational time scale to steer post-transition state trajectories toward the Diels\textendash Alder adduct.},

This important concept in reaction mechanisms is revealed by the fine structure of the reaction force constant               {$\kappa$}               (               {$\xi$}               ) along the transition region. Some wave function theory (WFT) based methods are also assessed against the CCSD(T) and CCSD benchmarks for the energy and geometry, respectively. The results and the statistical analysis of the errors confirm the robustness of SCS-MP2 (a WFT-based method) as one of the most reliable computational approaches. Regarding DFT-based methods, hybrid exchange\textendash correlation functionals combined with medium-range electron correlation effects or long-range corrected exchange appear as the best performing methods, highlighting both M11 and M06-2X, since a certain percentage of exact Hartree\textendash Fock exchange could counterbalance the delocalization errors that affect pure functionals. Thus, they reliably describe energetics, geometries and the degree of synchronicity in the formation of new C\textendash C single bonds in Diels\textendash Alder reactions. Noticeably, moderate performance for double hybrid functionals and poor performance for the most popular B3LYP method were found as well.},

The utility of a given computational approach depends largely on the balance it provides between accuracy and computational cost. Molecular crystals are a class of materials of great technological importance which are challenging for even the most sophisticated ab initio electronic structure theories to accurately describe. This is partly because they are held together by a balance of weak intermolecular forces but also because the primitive cells of molecular crystals are often substantially larger than those of atomic solids. Here, we demonstrate that diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) delivers subchemical accuracy for a diverse set of molecular crystals at a surprisingly moderate computational cost. As such, we anticipate that DMC can play an important role in understanding and predicting the properties of a large number of molecular crystals, including those built from relatively large molecules which are far beyond reach of other high-accuracy methods.},

  abstract = {Accurately predicting the spin splitting energy of chemical species is important for understanding their reactivity and magnetic properties, but it is very challenging, especially for molecules containing transition metals. One impediment to progress is the scarcity of accurate benchmark data. Here we report a set of calculations designed to yield reliable benchmarks for simple transition-metal complexes that can be used to test density functional methods that are affordable for large systems of more practical interest. Various wave function methods are tested against experiment for Fe2+, Fe3+, and Co3+, including CASSCF, CASPT2, CASPT3, MRCISD, MRCISD+Q, CCSD(T), and CASPT2/CCSD(T), and also a new method called CASPT2.5, which is performed by taking the average of the CASPT2 and CASPT3 energies. We find that MRCI+Q, ACPF, and AQCC require smaller active spaces for good accuracy than are required by CASPT2 and CASPT3, and this aspect may be important for calculations on larger molecules, here we found that CASPT2.5 extrapolated to a complete basis set is the most suitable method \textendash{} in terms of computational cost and in terms of accuracy on monatomic systems \textendash{} and therefore we chose this method for molecular benchmarks. Then Kohn-Sham density functional calculations with 60 exchange-correlation functionals are tested for FeF2, FeCl2, and CoF2. We found that MN15-L, M06-SX, and revM06 have very good agreement with CASPT2.5 benchmarks in terms of both the spin splitting energy and the optimized geometry for each spin state. In addition, we recommend def2-TZVP as the most suitable basis set to perform density functional calculations for molecular spin splitting energies; extra polarization functions in the basis set do not help to increase the accuracy of the spin splitting energy in KS calculations.},

We also provide a full discussion of the new M05 functional, previously presented in a short communication. The M05 functional was parametrized including both metals and nonmetals, whereas M05-2X is a high-nonlocality functional with double the amount of nonlocal exchange (2X) that is parametrized only for nonmetals. In particular, M05 was parametrized against 35 data values, and M05-2X is parametrized against 34 data values. Both functionals, along with 28 other functionals, have been comparatively assessed against 234 data values: the MGAE109/3 main-group atomization energy database, the IP13/3 ionization potential database, the EA13/3 electron affinity database, the HTBH38/4 database of barrier height for hydrogen-transfer reactions, five noncovalent databases, two databases involving metal-metal and metal-ligand bond energies, a dipole moment database, a database of four alkyl bond dissociation energies of alkanes and ethers, and three total energies of one-electron systems. We also tested the new functionals and 12 others for eight hydrogen-bonding and stacking interaction energies in nucleobase pairs, and we tested M05 and M05-2X and 19 other functionals for the geometry, dipole moment, and binding energy of HCN-BF3, which has recently been shown to be a very difficult case for density functional theory. We tested eight functionals for four more alkyl bond dissociation energies, and we tested 12 functionals for several additional bond energies with varying amounts of multireference character. On the basis of all the results for 256 data values in 18 databases in the present study, we recommend M05-2X, M05, PW6B95, PWB6K, and MPWB1K for general-purpose applications in thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions involving nonmetals and we recommend M05 for studies involving both metallic and nonmetallic elements. The M05 functional, essentially uniquely among the functionals with broad applicability to chemistry, also performs well not only for main-group thermochemistry and radical reaction barrier heights but also for transition-metal-transition-metal interactions. The M05-2X functional has the best performance for thermochemical kinetics, noncovalent interactions (especially weak interaction, hydrogen bonding, pi center dot center dot center dot pi stacking, and interactions energies of nucleobases), and alkyl bond dissociation energies and the best composite results for energetics, excluding metals.},

The M06-L functional and 14 other functionals have been comparatively assessed against 22 energetic databases. Among the tested functionals, which include the popular B3LYP, BLYP, and BP86 functionals as well as our previous M05 functional, the M06-L functional gives the best overall performance for a combination of main-group thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, and organometallic, inorganometallic, biological, and noncovalent interactions. It also does very well for predicting geometries and vibrational frequencies.

  abstract = {We present a new density functional called M06-HF. The new functional has full Hartree-Fock exchange, and therefore it eliminates self-exchange interactions at long range. This leads to good performance in TDDFT calculations of both Rydberg and charge-transfer states. In addition, the functional satisfies the uniform electron gas limit, and it is better than the popular B3LYP functional, on average, for ground-electronic-state energetics.},

  abstract = {We propose three small sets of barrier heights for heavy-atom transfer, nucleophilic substitution, and unimolecular and association reactions as benchmarks for comparing and developing theoretical methods. We chose the data sets to be statistically representative subsets of the NHTBH38/04 database. Each data set consists of 6 barrier heights; we call these small benchmark suites HATBH6, NSBH6, and UABH6. Benchmark values are tabulated for 205 combinations of theory level and basis set. The theory levels studied include single-level wave function theory like Hartree-Fock, M\o ller-Plesset perturbation theory, quadratic configuration interaction, and coupled cluster theory; they also include multicoefficient correlation methods, local and hybrid density functional theory, and semiempirical molecular orbital methods. The three new representative data sets are combined with a previous representative data set for hydrogen-transfer reactions to form a new compact but diverse and representative data set called DBH24. Comparison of a large number of methods for their performance on DBH24 leads us to recommend the following methods for barrier height calculations, in order of decreasing cost:\, G3SX, BMC-CCSD, PWB6K, BB1K, M06-L, MPW1K, HF/MIDI!, and PM3.},
